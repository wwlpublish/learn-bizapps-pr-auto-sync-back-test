In this module, you solved three different business problems by using data modeling techniques and DAX calculations.

- You created the on-time performance report that involved using Power Query to add columns to simplify the DAX calculation logic.
- You created a disconnected table to allow report consumers to scale measures to the hundreds, thousands, or millions.
- You created a disconnected table and added calculated columns to dynamically classify products into price bands.
