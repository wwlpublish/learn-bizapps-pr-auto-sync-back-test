  When your app users should only have access to view a subset of data, you need to develop a solution that restricts access to Power BI dataset data. The reason might be because some users aren't permitted to view specific data, such as sales results of other sales regions. Achieving this requirement commonly involves setting up row-level security (RLS), which involves defining roles and rules that filter model data.

  When using the *For your organization* scenario, developers of the data model and dataset must enforce RLS and ensure that internal users are mapped to security roles.

  When you’re using the *For your customers* scenario, your app must set the effective identity to restrict access to data. This effective identity determines how Power BI will connect to the model and how it will enforce RLS security roles. How you set up the effective identity depends on the type of Power BI dataset.

  > [!TIP]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features that are announced in the <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog" target="_blank">Microsoft Power BI Blog</a>. You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.

    In this module, you'll learn how to: 
    - Restrict access to Power BI dataset data.
    - Set up RLS in Power BI datasets.
    - Determine the different types of Power BI datasets.
    - Set up effective identity when generating an embed token.
    - Apply good development practices to enforce data permissions.
prerequisites: Experience developing web apps and creating Power BI workspaces and content, familiarity with the two embedding scenarios, *For your organization* and *For your customers*, and knowledge of how to generate embed tokens
