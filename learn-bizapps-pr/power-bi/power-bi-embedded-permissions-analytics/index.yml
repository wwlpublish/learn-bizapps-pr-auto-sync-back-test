  When your app users must only see a subset of data, you need to develop a solution that restricts access to Power BI dataset data. It could be because some users aren't permitted to see specific data, like sales results of other sales regions. Achieving this requirement commonly involves setting up row-level security (RLS), which involves defining roles and rules that filter model data.

  When using the *For your organization* scenario, data model and dataset developers must enforce RLS and ensure internal users are mapped to security roles.

  When using the *For your customers* scenario, your app must set effective identity to restrict access to data. It's the effective identity that determines how Power BI connects to the model and how it enforces RLS security roles. How you set up effective identity depends on the type of Power BI dataset.

  > [!TIP]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features that are announced in the <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog" target="_blank">Microsoft Power BI Blog</a>. You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.

    In this module, you'll learn to: 
    - Restrict access to Power BI dataset data.
    - Set up RLS in Power BI datasets.
    - Determine the different types of Power BI dataset.
    - Set up effective identity when generating an embed token.
    - Apply good development practices to enforce data permissions.
prerequisites: Experience developing web apps and creating Power BI workspaces and content, and familiarity with the two embedding scenarios, *For your organization* and *For your customers*, and how to generate embed tokens.
