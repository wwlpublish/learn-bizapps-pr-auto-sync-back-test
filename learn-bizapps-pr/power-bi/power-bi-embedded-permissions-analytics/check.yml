  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Barry is a data modeler at the Tailspin Toys company who is developing a Power BI Desktop model that must enforce RLS. It must restrict access to specific product categories. Presently, the company sells products across four categories, and it's possible that the organization will add new categories in the future. The design shouldn't require republishing the model when the company defines new categories. What should Barry do?
    choices: 
    - content: Create one role for each product category.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Creating one role for each product category will involve creating static roles. It will require republishing the model to the Power BI service.
    - content: Create one role and use the USERPRINCIPALNAME function to filter the **Category** column of the **Product** table.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Creating one role that uses the USERPRINCIPALNAME function implies the creation of a dynamic role. The app can pass the product category in as the username. When new product categories are defined, it will not require republishing the model to the Power BI service.
    - content: Create one rule for each product category.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The solution requires creating a role when a rule is required. There can only be one rule for a table.
    - content: Create one rule and use the USERPRINCIPALNAME function to filter the **Category** column of the **Product** table.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The solution requires creating a role when a rule is required.
  - content: Camila is a BI developer at the Tailspin Toys company who is developing a Power BI Desktop import model for a large data warehouse. The model must enforce RLS, and the Power BI reports that connect to the model should deliver the fastest possible performance. What should Camila do?
    choices: 
    - content: Apply rules to dimension tables.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. It's efficient to apply rules to dimension tables. Power BI filters the dimension tables (that usually have a few rows) and uses model relationships to propagate those filters to fact tables (that contain millions of rows).
    - content: Apply rules to effective identities.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. It's not possible to apply rules to effective identities.
    - content: Apply rules to fact tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. While rules can be applied to fact tables, it's not as efficient as applying rules to the dimension tables. When rules are applied to dimension tables, Power BI uses model relationships to efficiently propagate filters to the fact tables.
    - content: Apply rules to model relationships.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. It's not possible to apply rules to model relationships.
  - content: Paulo is a developer at the Tailspin Toys company who is developing an app that embeds Power BI reports. The reports use a DirectQuery model that sources its data from an Azure SQL Database and is set up to use the users' OAuth2 credentials. The database already enforces RLS for specific Azure AD accounts. The embedded Power BI reports must enforce the same RLS. What parameter should Paulo use when generating an embed token with the \`GenerateTokenRequestV2\` method?
    choices: 
    - content: \`CustomData\`
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This solution requires using token-based identity. In this case, the \`CustomData\` parameter isn't relevant and shouldn't be set.
    - content: \`IdentityBlob\`
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. By passing the Azure AD access token to the \`IdentityBlob\` parameter, the Azure SQL Database can run queries in the context of the associated user account. This approach is known as token-based identity.
    - content: \`Roles\`
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This solution requires using token-based identity. In this case, the \`Roles\` parameter isn't relevant and shouldn't be set.
    - content: \`Username\`
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This solution requires using token-based identity. In this case, the \`Username\` parameter isn't relevant and shouldn't be set.
