When enforcing RLS using the *For your customers* scenario, your app must set effective identity. How you set effective identity depends on the type of Power BI dataset that the app requires.

There are four different types of datasets to consider. These types are determined by where the model is hosted and the model framework. The remainder of this unit describes the four different types of datasets.

By definition, a Power BI dataset is an artifact that represents a source of data for visualization in Power BI. Commonly, datasets represent *data models*, which are query-able data resources optimized for analytical reporting.

## Model architecture

Most Microsoft data models are *tabular*. Tabular models comprise one or more tables. Other Microsoft data models are *multidimensional*. Multidimensional models rely upon older (yet still relevant) technology, and they comprise dimensions and measure groups. Often multidimensional models are called *cubes*.

> [!NOTE]
> Like tabular models, multidimensional models enforce data permission by using roles. However, they don't define filters by using rules, and they rely on Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) instead of DAX. While multidimensional models don't enforce RLS (because multidimensional models don't store rows of data), they enforce equivalent requirements that produce the same result of (static and dynamic) tabular model rules.

## Model hosting

Data models are either *internal-hosted* or *external-hosted*. Internal-hosted models reside **inside** Power BI, while external-hosted models are hosted **outside** Power BI.

Internal-hosted models reside in Power BI workspaces. Microsoft external-hosted models reside either in [Azure Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-overview/?azure-portal=true) or [SQL Server Analysis Services](/analysis-services/analysis-services-overview?view=asallproducts-allversions/?azure-portal=true). SQL Server Analysis Services can host both tabular and multidimensional models, and Power BI requires a [gateway](/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-onprem/?azure-portal=true) in order to connect to them.

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI connections to external-hosted models are referred to as *live connection*s.

## Model framework

Each table (except calculated tables) in a tabular model has a storage mode setting. It's either *Import*, *Dual*, or *DirectQuery*.

A model table set to use import storage physically loads and stores source data. It relies upon regular data refresh to keep data current. Import storage provides the fastest query performance, but it can be inefficient (or expensive) when you have large volumes of data. Also, when users must see up-to-date data, it might not be possible (due to daily limits) to refresh the dataset often enough.

Conversely, a model that uses DirectQuery storage mode never stores sources data. Instead, when model tables are queried, the model queries the source data. It's known as a *passthrough query*. DirectQuery storage mode can be a good choice when you have large data volumes or there's a need to report on up-to-date data.

When a table is set to use Dual storage mode, it can behave as either an import or DirectQuery table. For each query, the model query engine determines the most efficient (fastest) mode to use.

## Summary

To correctly set effective identity, you must determine which type of dataset you have. It's either:

-   Internal-hosted with import tables

-   Internal-hosted with DirectQuery tables

-   Azure Analysis Services, which is an external-hosted model

-   SQL Server Analysis Services, which is an external-hosted model
