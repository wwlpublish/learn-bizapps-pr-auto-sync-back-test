You can set effective identity when working with the *For your customers* scenario, when generating an embed token.

First, your app logic creates a list of one or more `effectiveidentity` objects. Each object can include the following parameters.

-   `Datasets` - Required. A list of DatasetIDs.

-   `Username` - Optional. For internal-hosted models, it's a text value to be returned by the USERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME function. For external-hosted models, it's the username to connect to the model.

-   `Roles` - Optional. List of role names.

-   `CustomData` - Optional. A text value to be returned by the CUSTOMDATA function.

-   `IdentityBlob` - Optional. An Azure AD access token used for token-based identity with a DirectQuery connection to a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. It allows enforcing data permissions without data model RLS. This topic is described later in this unit.

You might pass in a list of datasets because the embed token will be used to embed many Power BI artifacts that connect to different datasets, or because a dashboard comprises tiles that connect to multiple datasets. When a list of multiple roles is passed in, all roles are simultaneously enforced. That means the user gets to see the union of the data that the roles grant.

The following example creates a list containing one `effectiveidentity` object. It passes in the username of the current app user, the **Region** role, and the first (and perhaps only) dataset found in the workspace.

```csharp
// Create effective identity for the first dataset
var datasetId = datasets[0].Id.ToString();
var effectiveIdentities = new List<EffectiveIdentity>() {
	new EffectiveIdentity(
		username: userProfile.Username,
		roles: new List<string> {"Region"},
		datasets: new List<string> {datasetId})
};
```

Second, to generate an embed token, the app passes the list to the `identities` parameter of the `GenerateTokenRequestV2` method. (There are other methods that generate embed tokens; each allows passing in a list of effective identities.)

```csharp
// Bundle token requests for the reports, datasets, and the workspace
var tokenRequest = new GenerateTokenRequestV2(
    reports: reportTokenRequests,
    datasets: datasetTokenRequests,
    targetWorkspaces: workspaceRequests,
    identities: effectiveIdentities
) ;
```

The following topics provide further details about setting effective identity for each of the Power BI dataset types.

### Set effective identity for internal-hosted import tables

When passing effective identity to connect to an internal-hosted model with import tables:

-   At least one role must be defined in the model.

-   The username must be passed, but it doesn't need to be a real username. The value passed in is returned by the USERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME function.

-   At least one role must be defined by the effective identity.

### Set effective identity for internal-hosted DirectQuery tables

Use the same guidance described for internal-hosted import tables.

In addition, it's possible to use *token-based identity*. Token-based identity allows you to specify the effective identity for an embed token by using an Azure AD access token, but only when the source is an Azure SQL Database. When generating the embed token, your app passes the access token to the `IdentityBlob` parameter. in this case, it's not necessary to pass a value to the `username` parameter.

Using token-based identity requires the dataset owner to set up the data source to use the end users' OAuth2 credentials. This way, Power BI uses the effective identity username to connect to the data source. It means that the database can enforce RLS instead of the data model.

For more information about token-based identity, see [Row-level security with Power BI Embedded (Token-based identity with Azure SQL Database).](/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-row-level-security?azure-portal=true#token-based-identity-with-azure-sql-database)

### Set effective identity for Azure Analysis Services

To set effective identity when using an Azure Analysis Services model, the embedding identity (service principal or master user account) must have at least read permission on the model.

When no effective identity is passed and the embedding identity account is an Analysis Services admin, all app users will see all model data. When the embedding identity account isn't an Analysis Services admin, data visibility is limited by that account's assigned roles.

> [!NOTE]
> When using service principal with an Azure Analysis Services model, the service principal itself must have Azure Analysis Services instance permissions. Using a security group that contains the service principal for this purpose doesn't work.

When passing effective identity to work with an Azure Analysis Services model:

-   At least one role must be defined in the model.

-   The username must be a master user account (UPN format) or service principal (ObjectID).

-   When no roles form part of the effective identity, roles assigned to the effective identity account are applied.

-   The USERNAME function will return the effective identity username.

### Set effective identity for SQL Server Analysis Services

To set effective identity when using an SQL Server Analysis Services model, the gateway data source credentials must be an Analysis Services admin.

The effective identity (service principal or master user account) must be a gateway admin or have **ReadOverrideEffectiveIdentity** permissions on the gateway data source. This permission can only be set by using the Power BI REST API.

When no effective identity is passed and the embedding identity account is an Analysis Services admin, all users see all model data. When the embedding identity account isn't an Analysis Services admin, data visibility is limited by that account's assigned roles.

When passing effective identity to work with an SQL Server Analysis Services model:

-   At least one role must be defined in the model.

-   The username must be a Windows account, using UPN or DOMAIN\username format.

-   The username must have read permission on the model.

-   When no roles form part of the effective identity, roles assigned to the effective identity username are applied.

-   The USERNAME function will return the effective identity username.

-   The use of the CUSTOMDATA function isn't supported.

### Compare dataset types

The following table compares effective identity parameter settings for the four dataset types.
