  Having developed your app with embedded Power BI analytics, a final consideration might be to automate the management of your solution. Automation can result in faster and more accurate solution management. There are three libraries that you can use to develop an automation solution.

  When designing a multi-tenancy app, workspace separation is the recommended embedded analytics multi-tenancy solution. Automating the onboarding of new tenants (customers) will ensure fast and accurate setup.
