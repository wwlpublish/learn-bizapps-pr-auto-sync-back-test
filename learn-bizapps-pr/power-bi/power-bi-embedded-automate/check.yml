  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Alice is a developer at Tailspin Toys who is developing an app that embeds Power BI content from a Power BI Embedded capacity. Part of the solution must monitor capacity metrics such as CPU, CPU per workload, and Overload to measure demand for computational resources. When demand suddenly increases, the solution should react by scaling up the capacity. Which automation library should Alice use to scale up the capacity?
    choices: 
    - content: Microsoft Graph
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Microsoft Graph performs operations on various Microsoft cloud services. However, it can't manage Power BI Embedded capacities.
    - content: Power BI Embedded Analytics Client API
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The Power BI Embedded Analytics Client API is a client side library that allows you to programmatically control your embedded Power BI content, by using JavaScript or TypeScript. It can't manage Power BI Embedded capacities.
    - content: Power BI Embedded ARM REST API
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The Power BI Embedded ARM REST API enables you to create, retrieve, update, and delete Power BI Embedded capacities. Scaling a capacity is achieved with the Update operation.
    - content: Power BI REST API
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The Power BI REST API provides service endpoints for embedding, administration, governance, and user resources. However, it can't manage Power BI Embedded capacities.
  - content: Nick is a member of a developer team at Tailspin Toys that is developing a multi-tenancy app that embeds Power BI real-time reports. Nick is responsible for developing an onboarding process that automates workspace separation to set up the tenant workspace and content. Which automation library should Nick use to create a workspace?
    choices: 
    - content: Microsoft Graph
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Microsoft Graph performs operations on various Microsoft cloud services. It can't create Power BI workspaces.
