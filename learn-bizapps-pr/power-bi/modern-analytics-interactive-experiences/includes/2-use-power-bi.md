While Power BI has countless features and gives developers a multitude of ways to interact with their data, Power BI empowers you to quickly create stunning reports with a friendly user interface while incorporating a variety of features to make data easy and beautifully accessible. In this unit, you will learn how Power BI makes creating beautiful data presentations easy.

  

## Power BI -- alignment and grouping

  

Power BI includes formatting and canvas layout features to make building well formatted reports straightforward such as the following:

  

- Align visual borders within the canvas.

  

- Visuals will "snap" into place when they align.

  

- Visuals can also be distributed horizontally and vertically.

- Group visuals together.

  

- Ctrl + click (or click + lasso) to select multiple items. Then right click and select **Group.**

  

- Lasso and group visuals to align and resize.

  

## Power BI -- Themes

  

You can change the entire theme right from the ribbon. You can use pre-defined themes or import your own custom theme to quickly change the design of the report.
