Developers can programmatically embed analytics in their apps to present data as in-context visualizations. This way, users can make decisions based on facts instead of opinions.

It's possible to embed any type of Microsoft Power BI content in apps:

- Power BI reports
- Specific report visuals
- Paginated reports
- Dashboards
- Specific dashboard tiles
- Even the Q&A natural language experience.

Moreover, real-time Power BI content will show up-to-date results in an embedding app. Developers can integrate content with the app in many different ways to provide a seamless experience, even branding Power BI as their own.

Usually, embedding requires a programmatic solution, especially when tight integration exists between the app and the Power BI content. For completeness, this module also describes no-code embedding approaches that could be suited to simpler requirements.

> [!TIP]
> Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features that are announced in the [Microsoft Power BI Blog](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/?azure-portal=true). You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.
