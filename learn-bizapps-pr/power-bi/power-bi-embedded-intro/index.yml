  Developers can programmatically embed analytics in their apps to present data as in-context visualizations. This way, users can make decisions based on facts instead of opinions.

  It's possible to embed any type of Microsoft Power BI content in apps:

  - Power BI reports
  - Power BI report visuals
  - Paginated reports
  - Dashboards
  - Specific dashboard tiles
  - Even the Q&A natural language experience.

  Moreover, real-time Power BI content will show up-to-date results in an embedding app. Developers can integrate content with the app in many different ways to provide a seamless experience, even branding Power BI as their own.

  Usually, embedding requires a programmatic solution, especially when tight integration exists between the app and the Power BI content. For completeness, this module also describes no-code embedding approaches that could be suited to simpler requirements.

  > [!TIP]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features that are announced in the [Microsoft Power BI Blog](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/?azure-portal=true). You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.
