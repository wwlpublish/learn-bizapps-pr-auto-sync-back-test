  Programmatic embedding of Power BI analytics always involves the selection and purchase of a product. The product can be Microsoft Power BI Premium or Microsoft Power BI Embedded. To make the right selection, you first need to determine whether the embedding scenario is for internal or external users.

  You should also consider the size of the product SKU, which determines Power BI capacity compute resources and memory. It's important that you size capacities to ensure reliability and performance, yet not overspend. Occasionally, you might also need to ensure that capacities will resize in response to sudden increases in demand for capacity resources.

  > [!TIP]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features that are announced in the [Microsoft Power BI Blog](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/?azure-portal=true). You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to embed Power BI content in your apps.
