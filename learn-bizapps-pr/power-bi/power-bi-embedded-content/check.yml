    choices: 
    - content: \`datasetID\` and \`embedUrl\`
      isCorrect: false

    - content: \`groupID\` and \`embedUrl\`
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. An app can't embed a Power BI report by using the \`groupID\` property, which is the unique identifier for a workspace.

  - content: Stanley is a developer at Tailspin Toys who needs to embed a Power BI report in an app. The report can connect to one of many datasets, each with the same schema but, which stores data for a different geographic region. Which property of the configuration object should Stanley set to connect to a certain dataset?
    choices: 
    - content: \`datasetBinding\`
