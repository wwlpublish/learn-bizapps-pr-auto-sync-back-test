title: Set up permissions to embed Power BI content
summary: |
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)]

  To start developing your app that embeds Power BI content, you should first know whether it's for internal or external users. When it's for internal users, your app must use the *For your organization* scenario, so it will use an interactive authentication flow. When it's for external users, your app must use the *For your customers* scenario, so it will use a non-interactive authentication flow.

  Your setup will involve creating an Azure AD app registration to establish an identity for your app. It allows your app to authenticate and acquire access tokens, which are necessary to embed Power BI content.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features we announce in the <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/" target ="_blank">Microsoft Power BI blog</a>. You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.
