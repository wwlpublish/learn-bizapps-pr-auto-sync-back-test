title: Use DAX in Power BI Desktop to solve business problems
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  In this module, you’ll solve three different business problems by optimizing the data model and creating Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) calculations. You’ll have an opportunity to create:
    - An airline on-time performance (OTP) report.
    - DAX calculations to scale measure values.
    - DAX calculations to dynamically classify products.
abstract: |  
    By the end of this module, you’ll be able to: 
    - Prepare the data model to simplify and optimize DAX calculation logic.
    -	Use the `CALCULATE` DAX function to modify filter context.
    - Create calculations to scale measure values.
    -	Create calculations to dynamically classify products. 
prerequisites: |
  - Experience with developing Power BI data models, reports, and dashboards
  -	Experience with creating calculated tables, calculated columns, and measures by using DAX
