  questions: 
  - content: Which statement about disconnected tables is true?
    choices: 
    - content: Disconnected tables can’t include any type of DAX calculation.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can add calculated columns or measures to a disconnected table.
    - content: Disconnected tables must be created as calculated tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. You can create a disconnected table by using Power Query to add a table to the model.
    - content: Disconnected tables allow report consumers to make selections that impact other calculations.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A disconnected table allows report consumers to filter it, and you can define DAX measures that use the filtered values in a meaningful way.
    - content: Disconnected tables are role-playing dimensions.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Any type of dimension table should be related to a fact table in the model.
  - content: Douglas is a data modeler at Adventure Works who wants to create a measure that counts the number of late sales order deliveries. The Sales table stores one row for each sales order, and it has a column named DeliveryStatus. Values in the DeliveryStatus column are Not yet delivered, On-time, or Late.
             Which measure expression should Douglas use?
    choices: 
    - content: CALCULATE(Sales, FILTER([DeliveryStatus] = "Late"))
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The expression that’s passed into the `CALCULATE` function can’t be a table. Also, the `FILTER` function is an iterator function that requires a table and an expression to filter by.
    - content: CALCULATE(Sales, [DeliveryStatus] = "Late")
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The expression that’s passed into the `CALCULATE` function can’t be a table.
    - content: CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sales), FILTER([DeliveryStatus] = "Late"))
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The `FILTER` function is an iterator function that requires a table and an expression to filter.
    - content: CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sales), [DeliveryStatus] = "Late")
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The `CALCULATE` function will count the rows in the Sales table where the DeliveryStatus column value is Late.
  - content: Marsha is a business analyst at Adventure Works who wants to create a measure that calculates a hypothetical Australian dollar sales amount based on US dollar sales. The model has a table named ExchangeRate that contains a single column named ExchangeRate. Rows of data store hypothetical exchange rate values. In the report, the report consumer will use a slicer to set the Australian dollar exchange rate. If the report consumer doesn’t slice by a single exchange rate, the US dollar amount should be shown. In the measure expression, which function, and setup of the function, should Marsha use to determine the exchange rate?
    choices: 
    - content: VALUES(ExchangeRate[ExchangeRate])
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `VALUES` function returns all values in the filter context, but it could return a table of values if multiple exchange rates are in the filter context.
    - content: VALUES(ExchangeRate[ExchangeRate], 1)
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The `VALUES` function returns all values in the filter context, but it could return a table of values if multiple exchange rates are in the filter context. Also, this function doesn’t accept an alternate value argument.
    - content: SELECTEDVALUES(ExchangeRate[ExchangeRate])
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. While the `SELECTEDVALUES` function returns the value in filter context for a single column, it will return BLANK if many values are in the filter context. If this function returns BLANK, it won’t meet the requirement to compute US dollar sales.
    - content: SELECTEDVALUES(ExchangeRate[ExchangeRate], 1)
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The `SELECTEDVALUES` function returns the value in filter context for a single column, and it will return 1 if many values are in the filter context. If it returns 1, then it will compute US dollar sales.
