  - content: Phoebe is a developer at Tailspin Toys who wants to allow users to store specific Power BI report page state, including filters. Users should be able to reapply that state again within the same report session. Which client API operation should Phoebe use to store report page state?
    choices:
    - content: Add report filters
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Adding report filters won't capture specific report page state. Instead, it will filter the entire report.
    - content: Apply bookmark state
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Applying bookmark state won't capture specific report page state. Instead, it will overwrite the report page state with the bookmark state.
    - content: Apply custom layout
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Applying a custom layout won't capture specific report page state. Instead, it will change the report page layout.
    - content: Capture bookmark state
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Capturing bookmark state will store specific report page state so that the user can reapply it later.
  - content: Itzik is a developer at Tailspin Toys who wants to allow users to personalize visuals. Which client API function should Itzik's app use?
    choices:
    - content: The `applyTheme` function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `applyTheme` function applies a new theme to the report page. It can't personalize a visual.
    - content: The `customLayout` function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `customLayout` function applies a new layout to the report page. It can't personalize a visual.
    - content: The `createVisual` function
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The `createVisual` function adds a new visual with a default layout to the authoring page.
    - content: The `updateSettings` function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `updateSettings` function applies new settings to an embedded artifact. It can't personalize a visual.
