In this unit, you'll explore the **Go from insights to quick action** showcase. Contoso, a sales company, needs to send coupons or discount vouchers to specific customers. This showcase demonstrates how Contoso achieved that requirement by using event handling and visual data export.

The embedded Power BI report will include various slicers across the top and a table visual of customers beneath. Use any slicer to filter the table visual so that it will result in a small subset of customers.

Select the **Create a campaign** button.

The report has raised the `buttonClicked` event and the app has responded by opening a dialog window. The dialog window used the `exportData` function to retrieve the customers from the report's table visual.

The dialog window allows users to optionally clear customers and then select **Send coupon** or **Send discount**. The app is responsible for recording and sending coupons or discount vouchers to the selected customers.
