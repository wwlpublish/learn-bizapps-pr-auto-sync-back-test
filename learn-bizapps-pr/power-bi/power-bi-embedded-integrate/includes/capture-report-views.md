The list of *views* is actually bookmarks. The `bookmarksManager.getBookmarks` function has retrieved the report's bookmark collection.

Select any bookmark to apply it to the report, and then notice that the page updates with a new state. The `bookmarksManager.apply` function has applied the bookmark to the report.

In the **Manufacturer** slicer, select the first manufacturer, **Abbas**.

Select **Save**. The `bookmarksManager.capture` function has created a personal bookmark.

Return to the saved views, where the Abbas bookmark appears at the bottom of the list.
