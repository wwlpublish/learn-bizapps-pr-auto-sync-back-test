title: Integrate content with the Power BI client APIs
summary: |
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)]

  Embedding Power BI content is just a first step because there's so much more potential. The Power BI client APIs let you achieve tight integration between the app and the content. The app can set up and automate operations and it can also respond to user initiated actions. It's also possible to integrate Power BI capabilities, including navigation, authoring, filters and slicers, menu operations, layout, and bookmarks.

  > [!TIP]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution. Be sure to keep abreast of new features we announce in the <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/" target="_blank">Microsoft Power BI Blog</a>. You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.
