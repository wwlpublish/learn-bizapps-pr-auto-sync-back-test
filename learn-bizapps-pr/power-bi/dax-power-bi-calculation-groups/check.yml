  questions: 
  - content: Elizabeth is a data modeler at Adventure Works who uses Power BI Desktop. Elizabeth wants to create a calculation group to show different measures in different time intelligence perspectives. What tool should Elizabeth install?
    choices: 
    - content: ALM Toolkit
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. ALM Toolkit is a schema compare tool for Power BI models and datasets. It doesn’t support the creation of calculation groups.
    - content: DAX Studio
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. DAX Studio is a feature-rich tool for DAX authoring, diagnosis, performance tuning, and analysis. It doesn’t support the creation of calculation groups.
    - content: Tabular Editor
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Tabular Editor 2 or Tabular Editor 3 supports the creation of calculation groups.
    - content: VertiPaq Analyzer
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. VertiPaq Analyzer is a tool for analyzing VertiPaq storage structures for a data model in Power BI or Microsoft Azure Analysis Services. It doesn’t support the creation of calculation groups.
  - content: Volodymyr is a data modeler at Adventure Works who wants to create a calculation group to show different measures in different time intelligence perspectives. The order of the calculation items must be customized. What should Volodymyr do?
    choices: 
    - content: Rename the calculations items so that they sort alphabetically.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. While this approach might achieve the desired sort order, it would involve naming calculation items in a way so that they sort alphabetically. Setting a calculation item property is a better way to achieve this requirement.
    - content: Set the Calculation Group Precedence property for each calculation item.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The Calculation Group Precedence property orders the evaluation of calculation groups when more than one calculation group is used by a visual.
    - content: Set the Ordinal property of each calculation item.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The Ordinal property allows you to customize the order of calculation items.
    - content: Add a calculated column to the calculation group.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. You can’t add a calculated column to a calculation group. Even if it were possible, it wouldn’t meet the requirements to customize the order of the calculation items.
  - content: Fenhua is a data modeler at Adventure Works who added a calculation group to show different measures in different time intelligence perspectives. When the model was published to the Power BI service, users reported that their reports, which connect to the model, now display errors.
             What should Fenhua do?
    choices: 
    - content: Create calculated columns for all aggregated columns and update reports to use them.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. When you add a calculation group to a model, it’s no longer possible to summarize columns. Adding calculated columns will not address the errors.
    - content: Create calculated items for all aggregated columns and update reports to use them.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. When you add a calculation group to a model, it’s no longer possible to summarize columns. Adding calculated items will not address the errors.
    - content: Create calculated tables for all aggregated columns and update reports to use them.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. When you add a calculation group to a model, it’s no longer possible to summarize columns. Adding calculated tables will not address the errors.
    - content: Create measures for all aggregated columns and update reports to use them.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When you add a calculation group to a model, it’s no longer possible to summarize columns. You’ll need to create measures and update visuals to use the measures instead.
