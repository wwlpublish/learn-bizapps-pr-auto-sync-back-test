title: Add DAX calculation groups to Power BI Desktop models
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Occasionally, you might need to add many similar measures to your model. For example, consider that your model includes measures for sales, cost, and profit. You then want to create a report that shows year-to-date (YTD) sales, YTD cost, and YTD profit, in addition to prior year (PY) sales, PY cost, and PY profit.
  Adding numerous measures can be time-consuming and can clutter the Fields pane with an overwhelming number of fields. Instead of creating each YTD and PY measure, you can quickly add these measures to your model by creating a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) calculation group.
