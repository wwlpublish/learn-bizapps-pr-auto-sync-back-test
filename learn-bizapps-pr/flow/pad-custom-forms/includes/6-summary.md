## Summary 

Custom forms enable users to create desktop flows that request multiple types of data in a single dialog. All custom form elements have an ID property that identifies them uniquely in the desktop flow and allows you to access their data. Apart from input elements, custom forms provide actions that work as buttons and implement additional functionality to the form.
