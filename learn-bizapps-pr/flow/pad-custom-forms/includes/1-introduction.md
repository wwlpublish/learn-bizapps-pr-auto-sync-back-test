Interacting with users is a critical part of most attended desktop flows, as many scenarios require user input or need to display information on the screen.

Desktop flows provide various message boxes actions that allow you to prompt users to provide data or/and display information.

Although these actions are ideal for handling a limited amount of data peruse, they can't handle scenarios where multiple data inputs are required.

The best candidate to automate these scenarios is the **Display custom form** action. This action enables you to create custom forms that contain multiple input elements in a single dialog.

In this module, you'll learn about the main functionality of the custom form designer and how to handle user-provided data.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to design your own custom forms and use them to request data for later use in your desktop flows.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Design a custom form from scratch
- Access the provided form data and use them in other actions in your desktop flow
- Visually customize a custom form

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the Power Automate for desktop console and flow designer.
