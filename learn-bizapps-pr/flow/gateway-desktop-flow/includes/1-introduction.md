Microsoft Power Automate for desktop allows you to automate actions that are required in your daily business processes that use desktop applications that aren't hosted on the cloud. However, you might have business processes that use desktop applications and cloud services. Combining desktop flows with cloud flows allows you to take advantage of both opportunities. With Power Automate for desktop, you can take information from services like Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Outlook into legacy applications by configuring a gateway to your desktop.

In this module, you will:

- Install the Power Automate desktop application

- Create a desktop flow

- Test the new flow
