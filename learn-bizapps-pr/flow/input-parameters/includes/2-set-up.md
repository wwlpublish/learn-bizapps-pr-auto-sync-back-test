Creating and running automation systems in Microsoft Power Automate requires you to have access to make changes to the environments in your tenant and ensure that you have the appropriate licenses and permissions. If you don't already have admin access to a valid tenant, you might want to [start a free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab&azure-portal=true). Also, you'll need a Power Automate user plan with attended RPA license to complete this module. You can sign up for a [free trial](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/?azure-portal=true) if you don't already have this license.

If you've completed the *Build your first Power Automate for desktop flow* module, you can skip to the next unit.

## Create a trial environment with database

After you've successfully signed in to a valid tenant, go to the [Microsoft Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments/?azure-portal=true). You'll need to create a trial environment with a database. Select **Environments** and then select your automatically created environment, **Demo (default)**.

If you're using an existing tenant rather than creating a trial for this exercise, you can use the default environment or create a new one to keep it separate from your existing solutions.

Now that you are in your chosen environment, add a database by selecting **Add database**. In the next dialog box, you can specify the requested values but can keep the defaults. Select **Add**. You might be prompted to sign in again before creating your database, after which your database should provision appropriately.

Creating your database might take up to one minute; afterward, you can continue to the next steps.

If you're using a trial environment, consider setting up a profile in your browser to prevent you from being signed out of your existing Microsoft account.

## Software installation

The following exercises will require various software to be installed on your computer. The following steps will guide you through the download and installation of Power Automate for desktop, the required extensions, and the Contoso Invoicing app.

If you have already installed Power Automate for desktop, ensure that you're running the latest available version.

### Power Automate for desktop

Go to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true) and sign in with the account that you used to create your environment and database. After you've signed in, select **My flows > Install > Power Automate for desktop**.

> [![Screenshot of Power Automate with the Install button expanded and Power Automate for desktop highlighted.](../media/3-install-power-automate-desktop.png)](../media/3-install-power-automate-desktop.png#lightbox)

When the download completes, select the file to open and run the installer. Select **Next** and, on the next screen, select the final check box and then select **Install**. This action will install the Power Automate for desktop and the browser extensions for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.

When the installation is complete, select the link of your preferred browser and then follow the instructions to enable the extension. After the extension has been enabled, you can launch the Power Automate for desktop app.

After launching the app, sign in by using the account that you used to set up your environment and database.

## Contoso Invoicing app

One major benefit of using desktop flows is the ability to take actions on desktop applications. For the flow that you'll create, you'll use an invoicing application to explore the concepts and actions that are available to you in desktop flows. After you complete the module, you can use what you have learned to run desktop flows on your own applications and automate existing processes.

Download the [Contoso Invoicing app](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/power-automate-desktop/contoso-invoice-app/ContosoInvoicingSetup.zip), extract the contents, and then install the application and explore the elements.

If you don't have a desktop app that is created to define inputs and outputs, do so now by following this module or on your own.
