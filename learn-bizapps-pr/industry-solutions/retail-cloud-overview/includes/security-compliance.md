First, let's touch on some of the issues that make security and compliance a unique challenge for the retail industry. Some specifics:

- There have always been a multitude of systems in the retail space from POS to CRM, and other improvised systems across a wide network of stores, production centers, fulfillment centers, and corp. There's also been an explosion of apps, devices, and users across and outside of the corporate network. As the organizational barriers blur between who is in your network and out of it, organizations struggle to manage identities for not only their employees but external partners, suppliers and distributors, and even end-consumers and customers or citizens.

- Retailers are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks, especially identity and software supply chain attacks. A growing number of attacks and leaks are coming from within. (Source: [National Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/blog/retailers-confront-growing-risk-cyberattacks/?azure-portal=true).) Note that "supply chain" here has a different meaning than the commonly understood meaning in retail related to logistics and transportation. Software supply chain security is primarily about the security of software code--traced back to its original sources--used by an entity and its third-party service providers throughout the full development and deployment lifecycle.

- Consumer privacy is imperative--and it impacts a brand's reputation and value when it isn't protected. But only 22% of retailers have optimally integrated a privacy plan into their business strategy. (Source: [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/consumer-privacy-in-retail.html/?azure-portal=true).)

- And finally, there are increasing compliance mandates across the globe pertaining to customer privacy. Nearly half of US states are developing data policy legislation, meaning there will be a patchwork of law, making compliance confusing and complex to manage. In Europe, GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive (ePR) aim at controlling the flow of data in the EU. The mandate applies to US websites who offer services to EU residents. The laws evolve all the time and management of this complex system is foundational to any business strategy.

## Security, identity, and threat protection

Microsoft helps you protect against the latest threats with intelligent tools to prevent attacks and react quickly to security events

### Identity and access

- Benefit from Azure Active Directory's rich set of security capabilities including multi-factor authentication and fine-grained Conditional
    Access policies.

- Create access policies and use multi-factor authentication based on specific retail personas, such as cashiers, managers, HR, and more.

- Microsoft adheres to the principle of zero standing access (ZSA) to customer data. Use Customer Lockbox to approve or reject customer data access requests in the exceptional situation where such access is needed

### Encryption

- Help increase compliance and protect sensitive data with Customer Managed Keys (CMK).

- Azure private link and network isolation will help ensure private access to Online Services protect connectivity with TLS 1.2 Encryption in Transit.

- Use endpoint encryptions based on devices and security needs to accommodate a complex retail ecosystem

### Threat protection

- Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.
