There are 40 petabytes of data generated every hour in retail, but it's hard to unlock the value. Customer touchpoints aren't talking to each other--they're siloed and disconnected. The same customer who completes a transaction on social media versus in-store may appear as two, three, or four different customers because their data sits in different databases, speaking different languages.

Most retailers are only set up to use a fraction of the data that's available. They lack the tools and technologies to extract business value from unstructured, dark data.

With Microsoft Cloud for Retail, we're using retail data models to bring multiple systems and applications together by providing a shared language for your applications. This simplifies data management and app development by unifying data into common formats and applying consistency across multiple apps and deployments.

What does this offer:

- **Industry specificity**: Use data models with retail-specific semantics

- **Interoperability**: Data models ingest, enrich, and unify data to break down data silos and ease interoperability through industry specific pre-built connectors

- **Faster innovation**: Extend the value of the platform with more solutions, analytics, and predictions

## Core components

The Microsoft Cloud for Retail uses a combination of Microsoft Products to address the industry prioritized scenarios focused on maximizing the value of your data. The illustration below reflects the required and recommended capabilities.
