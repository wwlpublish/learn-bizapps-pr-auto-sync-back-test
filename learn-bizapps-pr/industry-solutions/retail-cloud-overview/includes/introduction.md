Microsoft Cloud for Retail provides capabilities to help you manage retail data at scale. Additionally, it helps make it easier for retail organizations to improve the customer experience and drive operational efficiency, while helping support security, compliance, and interoperability of retail data.

The following sections explain how retail is currently in transition and how Microsoft Cloud for Retail is helping transform the retail journey.

## Retail industry and shifting priorities

With the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other disruptions in the industry, retailers' priorities are shifting.

Today, retailers are focused on the following priorities:

- **Transforming the shopping experience**. For example, 72 percent of consumers say that they only engage in personalized marketing.

- **Creating loyal customers**. Currently, 75 percent of US consumers have reported new shopping behaviors, which isn't surprising given the rise of social media, curbside pickup, personalized shopping experiences, and more.

- **Enabling agile, resilient businesses**. The need to adapt quickly to meet shifting needs is more present than before. For example, 75 percent of specialty retailers are aiming to offer two-day or faster delivery.

However, retailers are finding that their technology is holding them back.

Retailers are dealing with massive amounts of siloed data. In fact, 40 petabytes of retail data is being generated every hour.

Furthermore, customer touchpoints are fragmented. Currently, 38 percent of retailers have difficulty unifying data across channels, and 34 percent have difficulty unifying data siloes organization-wide, with 31 percent of retailers saying that they can't track consumers across devices.

Internally, companies have limited visibility of their supply chain. Companies are experiencing 34 percent of on-time performance of container shipments, an all-time low.

Fortunately, these barriers aren't insurmountable.

## Priority retail scenarios

In response to the industry's focus on cloud services, Microsoft has prioritized the development of services that are specific to the industry. Microsoft Cloud for Retail is built on a foundation of privacy, security, and regulatory compliance across Microsoft and the partner ecosystem.

Microsoft Cloud for Retail is a collection of proven tools to connect your customers, your people, and most importantly, your data. Microsoft Cloud for Retail is an industry-specific cloud that introduces capabilities for retail customers across the following four key parameters:

- **Maximize the value of your data** - Retailers are challenged to unify vast and increasing amounts of data across various sources that don't necessarily communicate well with one another. Maximizing the value of your data is about unifying these data sources to realize greater value across your enterprise.

- **Elevate the shopper experience** - Retail customers demand an experience that is tailored to their tastes and that respects their time and energy. These tools help foster stronger customer relationships, increase online and offline cart size, and drive loyalty.

- **Build a real-time, sustainable supply chain** - Currently, supply chain stability and agility are perhaps the most pressing frontiers for retail organizations around the world. As a result, Microsoft has dedicated solutions that include AI to provide visibility across your entire supply chain and to predict and manage changes in supply and demand at all points.

- **Empower the store associate** - Microsoft provides modern work solutions that help manage burnout so that store associates can be as effective and empowered as possible. You can equip your retail workforce with solutions to increase customer satisfaction while reducing the burden on your frontline and empowering your team's growth.

Every pillar of Microsoft Cloud for Retail is supported by a foundation of trust. Your customers and your data are vital to you, so it's imperative that you own and control it at every stage. Microsoft supports that ideal with identity and data privacy and security.
