Today, retailers are focused on:

**Transforming the shopping experience.** For example, 72% of consumers say they only engage in personalized marketing.

**Creating loyal customers is also a top priority.** 75% of US consumers have reported new shopping behaviors, which isn't surprising, given the rise of social media, curbside pickup, personalized shopping experiences, and more.

**Retailers are also focused on enabling agile, resilient businesses.** The need to adapt and change quickly to meet shifting needs is more present than ever before. For example, 75% of specialty retailers are aiming to offer two-day or faster delivery.

But retailers are finding that their technology is holding them back.

First, they're dealing with **massive amounts of siloed data.** In fact, 40 petabytes of retail data being generated every hour.

Furthermore, **customer touchpoints are fragmented.** 38% of retailers have difficulty unifying data across channels and 34% have difficulty unifying data siloes organization-wide with 31% of retailers say they can't track consumers across devices.

On the back end, companies have **limited visibility of their supply chain.** Companies are experiencing 34% on-time performance of container shipments, an all-time low.

Fortunately, these barriers aren't insurmountable.

## Priority retail scenarios

In response to industry's focus on Cloud Services, Microsoft has prioritized developing services specific to the industry. Microsoft Cloud for Retail, built on a foundation of privacy, security, and regulatory compliance across Microsoft and the partner ecosystem.
