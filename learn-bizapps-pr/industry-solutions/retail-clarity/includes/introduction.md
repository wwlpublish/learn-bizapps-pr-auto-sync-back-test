Shopper and operations analytics priority helps you unlock omnichannel insights with advanced analytics. With shopper and operations analytics, you can predict customer and operational needs, monitor and understand online engagement, and unify data integration, warehousing, and analytics.

You can monitor and understand engagement by:

-   Using the Heatmap feature to determine where your site generates the most clicks, what people are ignoring, and how far they're scrolling.

-   Observing how customers use your site with anonymized, hi-definition recordings. Additionally, you can discover user frustrations by documenting rage clicks, dead clicks, and quick-backs with behavior-focused insights, allowing you to develop solutions more efficiently.

-   Learning about customer engagement by using built-in web and mobile analytics and return customer activity recognition, allowing you to create custom reports and views based on real-time customer behavior data.

Microsoft Clarity focuses on the **Shopper and operations analytics** part of the **Maximize the value of your data** priority scenario of Microsoft Cloud for Retail. It provides insight on your website’s usage patterns as an e-commerce web shop that’s built on [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce](/commerce/overview/?azure-portal=true), a custom e-commerce website, or a website for providing information about your physical shop.

In this lab, you'll assume the role of a system administrator of Fabrikam UK website. Fabrikam UK is using an ASP.NET website. You want to track, monitor, and analyze the user behavior on both websites to provide a better user experience. For that purpose, you'll integrate both websites with Microsoft Clarity.

> [!NOTE] 
> For the sake of Azure deployment simplicity, you’ve been provided with a basic, multipage, no image-containing web application to represent the Fabrikam UK website.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

-   Create a Microsoft Clarity project.

-   Integrate Microsoft Clarity with a custom website.

-   Interact with Microsoft Clarity dashboards, heatmaps, and recordings.

**Bonus learning opportunity** - Because part of this lab needs an up-and-running sample website to do the integration, you'll also learn how to deploy an ASP.NET website to Microsoft Azure App Service with Visual Studio Code in the upcoming exercises.
