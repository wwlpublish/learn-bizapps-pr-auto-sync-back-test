In this exercise, you'll review the output of the Retail churn model.

1.  Open the Retail churn model to view its contents, where you'll find three main areas:

	- **Training model performance** - Displays a letter grade of how well the model has performed.
	
	- **Likelihood to churn (number of customers)** - This area can be read as X customers are Y percent likely to churn.
	
	- **Most influential factors** - This area is considered by AI in predicting the model. This area will vary depending on the dataset.

1.  To view a customer's full profile in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, go to **Customers** and open any sample record.

1.  To view the calculated churn scores, go to **Data**, and then under **Entities**, open the **msfsiRetailBankingChurn** entity that was created when you ran the churn model.

1.  On the **Attributes** tab, view the various new columns that were created by the model that factor into the score:

	- **ExpFeature1** = Contact related factors
	
	- **ExpFeature2** = Digital transaction factors
	
	- **ExpFeature3** = Physical transaction factors
	
	- **ExpFeature4** = Digital session factors
	
	- **ExpFeature5** = Physical session factors

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Screenshot of the attributes list, showing the new columns that were added.](../media/attributes.png)

1.  Select the **Data** tab to view the calculated churn score for each **CustomerID** in the dataset.

Congratulations, you’ve successfully run the Retail churn model in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.
