Retail workforce management helps you digitize managerial tasks, such as store scheduling.

With retail workforce management, you can manage shifts seamlessly, connect to your existing workforce, simplify task dissemination, and help your team complete tasks more easily.

With retail workforce management, you can offer seamless scheduling:

- **Manage shifts seamlessly** - Enable managers to create and manage their team's schedule and let employees set their availability and adjust schedules to fluctuating business needs.

- **Track time and attendance** – Employees can clock in and out with geo detection and digital time tracking sheets.

- **Enable Shifts connectors with workforce management systems** – Provide real-time visibility into labor scheduling, time and attendance, and store operation scheduling in a single interface, ensuring a seamless and accurate scheduling experience.

Additionally, you’ll experience simplified task management:

- Enable corporate employees, such as the corporate communications and the retail operations teams, to create, distribute, and track task assignments to a targeted location.

- Equip managers with the ability to manage tasks regionally and assign them to the correct individuals in the store.

- Provide frontline workers with the ability to complete tasks locally with clear, detailed directions from HQ or Operations.
