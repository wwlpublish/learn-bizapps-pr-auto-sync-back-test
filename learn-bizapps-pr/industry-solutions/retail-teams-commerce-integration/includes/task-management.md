In this exercise, you'll use the three users created in the previous exercise for Retail communication manager, store manager and store employee to practice how task management works in Dynamics 365 Commerce. First, you'll play the role of a Retail communications manager who will sign in to Teams and publish a task "Setup Women's Spring Lineup Display" and then you'll play the role of a Store manager who will sign in to Dynamics 365 Commerce POS application to view the tasks and assign the new task to a store employee. Finally, you'll play the role of a store employee who will view the assigned tasks and mark them as complete once they complete the task.
