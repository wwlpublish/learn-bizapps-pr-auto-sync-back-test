DICOM is an important standard for enabling interoperable exchange of medical imaging data. You can store images and transmit them between systems, such as DICOM-compatible devices, PAC systems, vendor neutral archives (VNAs), and more.

DICOM service within Azure Health Data Services helps health organizations to persist medical imaging data in the Microsoft cloud in a more secure manner. DICOM service is a managed Azure service that allows standards-based communication with any DICOMweb™ enabled systems. Additionally, an open-source version is available: [Medical Imaging Server for DICOM](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/?azure-portal=true).

By using the DICOM service as a building block in Azure Health Data Services, you can realize novel solutions in storing, connecting, and using medical imaging data to help improve health outcomes.
