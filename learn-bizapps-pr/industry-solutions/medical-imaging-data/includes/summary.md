DICOM is an important standard for enabling interoperable exchange of medical imaging data. Images can be stored and transmitted between systems such as DICOM-compatible devices, PAC systems, vendor neutral archives (VNAs) and more.

DICOM service within Azure Health Data Services enables health organizations to securely persist medical imaging data in the Microsoft cloud. DICOM service is a managed Azure service that allows standards-based communication with any DICOMweb™ enabled systems. Additionally, there's also an open-source version, [Medical Imaging Server for DICOM](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/?azure-portal=true).

Using the DICOM service as a building block in Azure Health Data Services, novel solutions can be realized in storing, connecting, and utilizing medical imaging data to help improve health outcomes.
