Microsoft isn't new to the topic of sustainability. For more than a decade, Microsoft has steadily built on a commitment toward innovation and investment in technologies to address environmental sustainability. 

Microsoft has landed important work since setting the first carbon emission reduction goal in 2009. Additionally, attention has been focused on where technology can have the greatest impact: in the areas of carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. 
 
- In 2020, Microsoft set new commitments to go beyond neutral to a real net zero target and has committed to become a carbon negative, water-positive, zero-waste company by 2030 in an effort to protect more land than it uses. 

- From 2030 to 2050, Microsoft will continue zeroing out annual emissions by removing all associated emissions since 1975.

These ambitious goals and established roadmaps have been set by a continual reliance on in-depth expertise in sustainability and software-driven innovation for data-driven approaches. Moreover, Microsoft has recognized that to succeed, it’s imperative to embed sustainability deeper into the culture. 

Microsoft is working closely with customers and partners to advance a collective progress because, for organizations of all kinds, in every industry, the overarching sustainability journey is similar. 

While making progress toward these bold commitments, Microsoft is translating these experiences, whether successes or setbacks, into helping partners and customers and advocating for policy change to help everyone move faster. Because everyone is on this journey together, more can be accomplished when everyone works and learns together.

When organizations are on their sustainability journey, Microsoft can accelerate progress to reach collective goals and create new value as follows:

- **Accelerate shared sustainability journey**- With over a decade of sustainability experience and continuous innovation integrated into technology, Microsoft products can help decarbonize and accelerate the environment, social, governance (ESG) journey.
- **Embed sustainability in everything** - The technology and partner ecosystem bring integrated solutions to connect organizations and their value chain.
- **Create new value with sustainability**- When creating a community of collective learning and action where data can be shared, insights delivered, and more common ways of working can be created. 

With more than a decade of sustainability experience and continuous innovation that’s integrated into technology, Microsoft technologies and partner solutions can help organizations decarbonize and accelerate their ESG journey in the following ways: 

- Minimize the environmental impact and empower other organizations to do the same by sharing knowledge and delivering products and solutions that can help in the decarbonization journey. 
- Build technologies with sustainability in mind.
- Deliver the world’s leading platform for technology solutions to environmental challenges, with built-in security, privacy, and compliance. 
- Unify data intelligence to help organizations measure and monitor their sustainability performance. 

Organizations can embed sustainability through their organization and value chain with integrated solutions that are available through the Microsoft platform and partner ecosystem:

Microsoft helps organizations create new value in a changing world by building a community of collective learning and action, where data can be shared, insights are delivered, and more common ways of working can be created. The ongoing innovation, global collaboration, and leadership are driving new standards, markets, and opportunities, including new products that help create new value for business and society.

Currently, Microsoft is working closely with customers and partners to understand how to use data intelligence to manage the risks that are associated with environmental impact, improve efficiencies, and build sustainable businesses for the future. As a result, these agile businesses can adopt new ways of operating, building, and delivering more sustainable products and services to the world. 

Together, everyone can build a more environmentally sustainable future by harnessing the power of technology.
