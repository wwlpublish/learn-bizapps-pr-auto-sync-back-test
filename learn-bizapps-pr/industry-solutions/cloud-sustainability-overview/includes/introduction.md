Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability helps organizations build more enduring IT infrastructures through identifying opportunities to replace tools, systems, and activities with more efficient options. Organizations can minimize the environmental footprint of their operational systems and processes. Furthermore, they can drive more sustainable value chains with greater transparency and accountability, from sourcing of materials through product distribution. 

As part of Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability:

- Microsoft Sustainability Manager unifies data intelligence to help organizations monitor and manage their sustainability performance. 
- Partner solutions seamlessly connect into Sustainability Manager.
- The **Emissions impact** dashboard provides customers with transparency into their use of Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. 

The world is facing an extraordinary challenge due to industrialization and overuse of limited resources. Climate change is already disrupting operations, supply chains, and economies. 

Amid this uncertainty is the clear notion that organizations of all types, sizes, and sectors will need to fundamentally transform common practices to meet a new sustainability imperative. Essentially, companies need to operate with less environmental impact while changing their business to meet the demands of a changing world.

The corporate vision and strategy will need to align with sustainability ambitions, and that cultural shift will need to happen across the organization, with sustainability a part of every organization’s core business. 

The good news is that these changes will create new business value with more circular and sustainable products, services, and investment areas, and it helps meet growing expectations among customers, investors, regulators, and employees. These stakeholders expect organizations to be more accountable for their impact, with greater transparency and action.

The work isn’t easy, but stakeholders assert (and continue asserting) that together, they can accelerate progress to reach the collective sustainability goals.

Climate scientists agree that aggressive action is needed right now to accelerate decarbonization. Stakeholders and regulators are applying pressure to organizations to report and reduce their carbon emissions. In fact, over the next decade, corporate reporting on carbon emissions is expected to become mandatory. This type of reporting requires carbon accounting. 

Carbon accounting is necessary for organizations to understand their climate impact and meet emissions reporting requirements.
