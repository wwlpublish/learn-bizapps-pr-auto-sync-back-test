You can use the MedTech service with the FHIR service in Microsoft Azure Health Data Services to import and maintain data from medical Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this module, you'll learn how to enable IoT data scenarios for remote patient monitoring. This IoT data can be ingested from devices, converted to FHIR resources, stored in a secure environment that's highly scalable, and then queried and displayed to end users for real-world action. Remote monitoring unlocks scenarios for such use cases as virtual care, asynchronous care, and decentralized clinical trials.

In this module, you'll:

-   Learn about the types of information that's received from medical IoT devices.

-   Discover the benefits of wearables in providing proactive monitoring.

-   Learn about the process for device data to become usable data that supports health workloads.
