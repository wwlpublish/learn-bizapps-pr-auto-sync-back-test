The MedTech service can be used with the FHIR service in Azure Health Data Services to import and maintain data from medical IoT (Internet of Things) devices. In this module, you'll learn how to enable IoT data scenarios for remote patient monitoring. This IoT data can be ingested from devices, converted to FHIR resources, stored in a secure environment that is highly scalable, and then queried and displayed to end users for real world action. Remote monitoring unlocks scenarios for such use cases as virtual care, asynchronous care, and decentralized clinical trials.

After completing this module, you will:

-   Recognize the types of information received from medical IoT devices

-   Describe the benefits of wearables in providing proactive monitoring

-   Identify the process for device data to become usable data supporting health workloads
