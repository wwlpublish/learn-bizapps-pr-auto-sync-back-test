  The Flexible fulfillment capability in the 'Build a real time sustainable supply chain' priority scenario helps Retailers optimize order management while giving their customers multiple options to engage across several channels.

  Flexible fulfillment delivers on enhanced customer experience capabilities such as streamlining curbside pickup and 'buy-online-pickup-in-store' operations, while providing customers with real-time inventory and order status, and greater control of the entire order lifecycle.

  To expand, the following are some of the ways Flexible fulfillment delivers on **enhanced customer experiences**:

  - Streamline returns management and enable flexible return scenarios
  - Use AI and anomaly detection models to identify and address fulfillment constraints and improve delivery times while reducing costs
  - Give customers ordering flexibility such as home delivery, curbside pickup, and pick up in-store with connected ordering and fulfillment tools
  - Offer real-time inventory availability and order status with AI, providing a single solution to order-fulfillment orchestration
