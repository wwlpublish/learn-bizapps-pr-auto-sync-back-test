In this module, you learned about the FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for health data storage and exchange. You learned about the FHIR data model and about how all FHIR resource types are defined with a set of elements. You also discovered how each resource instance on a FHIR server is distinguished by the unique set of information that's carried in those elements.

Additionally, you learned how FHIR profiles define a baseline set of resources for operationalizing FHIR data in real-world healthcare settings. You also learned about how the FHIR RESTful API enables the exchange of FHIR data. Developers can take advantage of the FHIR API with SMART on FHIR to build more secure, user-facing applications that interact with FHIR data. These capabilities and more are supported by the FHIR service within Azure Health Data Services.

This module emphasized the importance of interoperability (the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and use information) within the health and life sciences industry. Finally, you learned how to ingest real-world data, translate it to real-world evidence, and drive clinical workflows as real-world action by using Azure Health Data Services.
