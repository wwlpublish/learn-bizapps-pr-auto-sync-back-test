In this module, we learned about the FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for health data storage and exchange. We learned about the FHIR data model, and we discussed how all FHIR resource types are defined with a set of elements. We covered how each resource instance on a FHIR server is distinguished by the unique set of information carried in those elements.

We also discussed how FHIR profiles define a baseline set of resources for operationalizing FHIR data in real-world healthcare settings. And, we talked about how the FHIR RESTful API enables the exchange of FHIR data. Developers can take advantage of the FHIR API with SMART on FHIR to build secure, user-facing applications that interact with FHIR data. These capabilities and more are supported by the FHIR service within Azure Health Data Services.

Throughout this module, we emphasized the importance of interoperability (the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information) within the health and life sciences industry. We walked through how to ingest real-world data, translate it to real-world evidence and drive clinical workflows as real-world action using Azure Health Data Services.
