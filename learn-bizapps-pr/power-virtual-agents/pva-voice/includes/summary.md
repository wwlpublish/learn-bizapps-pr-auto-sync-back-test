Configuring a Power Virtual Agent bot for voice support means that the same conversational style bot that you are leveraging with traditional text-based channels such as chats, SMS, or social media, can also be leveraged across voice channels.  Customers who are on the phone will be able to have a natural conversation with the bot, which will interact and assist them as a live person would.  Customers who are leveraging Dynamics 365’s first party voice offering can easily enable voice functionality for any Power Virtual Agent bot they create, without needing to do anything different during the design process of the bot.
