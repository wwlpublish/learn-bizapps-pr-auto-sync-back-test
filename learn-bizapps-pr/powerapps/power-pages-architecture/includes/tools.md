Microsoft Power Platform provides many tools to help you administer, configure, and fine-tune a Power Pages site to meet specific business requirements.

## Power Pages design studio

The studio is used for quickly defining a site structure with webpage management, creating page layouts, embedding forms and lists, applying themes, and editing page templates.

## Portal Management app

Not all portal configuration features are available in the Power Apps design studio. Portal Management is a Power Apps model-driven app that allows makers to add, modify, or delete any of the portal metadata rows that define the portal functionality and appearance. The Portal Management app can be used for creating and editing content snippets, managing advanced options for basic forms, advanced forms, and lists, and other advanced configuration tasks.

> Incorrectly modifying the portal metadata might have undesirable effects on the operation and appearance of your portal.
