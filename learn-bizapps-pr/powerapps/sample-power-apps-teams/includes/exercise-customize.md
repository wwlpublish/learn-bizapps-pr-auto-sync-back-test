### Task - Customize the Manage Issues app

1. In Teams, select ... to launch Power Apps (if not already visible on the navigation menu).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of launching Power Apps.](../media/power-apps-app.png)

1. Select the **Build** tab and select the Team where you installed the Issue Reporting app earlier in this lab. Select the **Installed apps** tab, then select **Manage issues** to launch the editing canvas for the Managed issues sample app.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Power Apps Build tab installed apps with issue reporting highlighted.](../media/installed-apps.png)](../media/installed-apps.png#lightbox)

1. Once the editing canvas is launched, select the stacked sheets icon from the menu on the left side of the screen to open the tree view.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Power Apps tree view.](../media/tree.png)

1. From the tree view, select the **Components tab**, and select to expand **comHeader**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Components tab in Power Apps tree view.](../media/components.png)

1. From the tree view under **comHeader**, select the component called **btnHeaderExternalLink**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of button in Power Apps editing canvas.](../media/button.png)](../media/button.png#lightbox)

1. With **btnHeaderExternalLink** selected, change the property dropdown of the formula bar at the top of the screen to **Fill**. Backspace to remove the existing formula in the formula bar, and type in **Red**. The selected button on the screen should become the color red.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of changing Fill formula.](../media/red.png)](../media/red.png#lightbox)

1. From the tree view, select the **Screens** tab and select another screen, for example, Issue Templates Screen. You can see that the button has now been changed to match the component that you edited.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of viewing the color change on a screen.](../media/screens.png)](../media/screens.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Save**, then **Publish to Teams**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Save and Publish to Teams button.](../media/publish.png)

1. Select **Next**, then **Save and close**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of publishing to Teams.](../media/next.png)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Power Apps add to channel.](../media/channel.png)

1. When you navigate back to your team and launch the Manage issues app, you'll see that the button color has been updated.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of viewing changes on published app.](../media/color.png)](../media/color.png#lightbox)
