We reviewed the current service process and found some obvious improvements to make:

- Go paperless for the entire process. (We noted the savings and environmental impact as a project benefit as well.)

- Automatically look up the gear being service based on the customer's purchase history.

- Do initial assessment checks and gather pictures if needed through the app (greatly reducing the time it takes to gather that information from four potential sales team members and end-to-end process time).

- Create weekly service reports automatically using the data.

- Send service reminders to customers every year.

- Automatically provide the customer with status updates as their gear is serviced.

- Quickly identify the customers affected by a manufacturer's recall.

And these automation opportunities don't address some obvious benefits in other departments as well, like sales. Being able to keep track of the life of gear allows the sales department to reach out to customers with opportunities to buy new gear, and even new training.
