If you're making your first app with Power Apps, think about your business and the work that you and your team do day to day, and identify a business problem that you currently are using a manual process to solve.

Potential use cases for automation are gaps, complaints, or inefficiencies that exist in your current work environment. Processes that still require paper or email, and processes that require manually moving data from one place to another (from email to a database or from one spreadsheet to another), are likely candidates for solving with an app.

It's good to know how the app you have in mind might benefit your colleagues and your boss. It's especially good when you need to ask for cooperation when making or using the apps. The list below shows the kinds of issues that can be solved by the platform:

- **Availability** - Accessing apps at anytime, anywhere

- **Mobility** - Allowing people to work with an app while on the move

- **Consolidation** - Gathering data in a more automated way to minimize manual consolidation

- **Training** - Getting people up to speed and tracking their training results and certifications

- **Democratization** - Enhancing the ability to self-solve problems within the department or section

- **Inclusion** - Reducing friction for employees who have different work environments from other employees (such as remote workers or people with disabilities)

- **Efficiency** - Reducing time required to get the desired outcome, reducing unnecessary steps

- **Productivity** - Increasing the throughput of a process

- **Timeliness** - Increasing the speed of end-to-end collaboration among different stakeholders

- **Scalability** - Allowing more throughput

- **Analysis** - Gathering required additional information, storing it in such a way that allows for easier analysis

- **Reporting** - Enabling faster or more complete reporting to management

- **Security** - Securely storing and working with data

- **Compliance** - Solving issues around handling personal information, meeting legal or accounting requirements

- **Sustainability** - Reducing waste (such as paper and electricity) and pollution

## Identifying key contributors

Think through everyone who contributes to this process. This includes people in your department and other departments who all work together on this problem. Understand what they do in the context of the business problem that's being solved.

When you start documenting the business process, you'll want to rely on these people to help you understand each step. You'll most likely learn along the way, and you might need to add new people to your project team to provide their perspectives.

In our example scenario, we identified these key contributors:

## Example: The cost of the current gear service process

- We found that it takes the sales staff roughly 15 minutes to check in a service customer. Each sales representative captures an average of six customers per day for gear service. The average cost of each salesperson is roughly $26 per hour.

  (4 sales members x 6 requests) 24 service requests per day equals $156 daily to create these service requests manually, or $1,092 per week.

  52 weeks x $1,092 = $56,784 a year.

- Tom and Steve in the service department spend on average 1 hour servicing each piece of gear, and due to the manual nature of service order intake they can only complete six service orders each per day even though they work 9 hours a day.

- Since the Service Team is only able to complete 12 service orders a day but they get an average of 24, they're backlogged in orders and either customers are taking their business elsewhere or they have to outsource some of it to competing dive shops in the area.

- The average revenue per transaction for service is $125, so the dive shop's service daily revenue is $3,000.

- Tom and Steve's average cost is $40 per hour, which equals to $540 per day.

- The dive shop spends an average of $74 in parts daily to service the gear.

  This brings the total cost of service to the shop to $770 per day.

  If the shop only completes 12 service orders per day the revenue for the day is $1,500 or $546,000 a year minus $280,280 for the cost of parts and labor equal a $265,720 profit for the shop.

Now imagine deploying a PowerApp that would minimize the cost of entering orders into the system while giving the service team members more time to fulfill even more orders. Let's say we cut the costs down on intake by half (taking 7.5 minutes to capture what's needed and collect pictures and a customer signature all from one device) and also the same solution will bring a centralized and streamlined system that Tom and Steve can follow so they can increase the number of orders they can fulfill daily to 8 each. How would those numbers look?

**New cost**: ($78 for data entry, $770 for the service team, $98 for service parts) $344,344 annually but the revenue goes to $728,000 for a profit of $383,656.

$383,656 - $265,720 = **$117,936 per year is the potential cost of doing nothing.**
