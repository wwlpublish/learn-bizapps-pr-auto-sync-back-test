Having a project plan ensures that you have the right resources (time, people, and funds) and follow a consistent approach to ensure a good level of quality for the apps you make.

Having a clear objective for what you and your project team are trying to achieve is important so that your project team members share the same goals. Writing down your goals is a good way to clarify what you want the app you're considering making to achieve. It also ensures you don't lose focus on what you need to create and what features to prioritize. For more information, see [Prioritizing features and requests](/power-apps/guidance/planning/prioritizing-features/?azure-portal=true).

If you have ambitious goals, you might want to start thinking about how to break down the project into incremental releases. (In a later section, we'll discuss the incremental release methodology.)

## Define the project scope

Make sure you scope the project so that you know how much you'll be trying to achieve from the project. Keep a clear road map for what you define as complete and what's outside the scope of the project (and, possibly, to be done in the next version). Your scope directly affects and determines which features to include and not to include when making the app.

To define the project scope, you should consider the following constraints:

> ![Diagram showing time, people, budget, and feasibility constraints.](../media/constraints.png)

- **Time**: Set a deadline for when you'd like to accomplish the project objectives. With smaller projects, this might be a few weeks, whereas larger projects might take several months.

- **People**: How many people are available for the project?

- **Budget**: If you need to account for time spent by you and your coworkers, or if you need to hire experts, you'll need to establish a budget.

- **Feasibility**: You might find you're constrained by available expertise, by lack of access to the data you need, or by the amount of change your organization has appetite for.

You should also consider what functional pieces you can deliver in usable chunks. It won't do anybody any good if your app only delivers halfway on several features; plan to deliver each component in a working form, end to end. Even if it doesn't yet have every feature you want, deliver something that can be used. Your project plan should specify what you'll deliver in each phase.

## Example: Dive shop service department solution

### Project plan

When we looked at the overall business goals for our solution, we decided to divide them into releases so that we could deliver value incrementally:

### Release 1

- Immediately upon solution availability, 100 percent of service request will be created using the digital system.

- Within two weeks of solution availability, the service team should be completing an average of 16 service orders per day.

### Release 2

- Every customer should be able to register their products within our system.

- By the end of the year, department managers can access a weekly service report that's up to date for all service orders in the system.

- Customers are now receiving reminders to service their gear. These reminders are sent annually, 30 days before the anniversary of the prior service order completion on the gear.

### More goals for release 1 of the solution

- User training should be minimal, and ease of use is paramount.

- The General Manager of the shop should be able to use service data to craft marketing campaigns and sales promotions targeting service customers.

## Project scope

Looking at our business process, we see that it's divided into four main tasks:

1. Creating a service order

2. Approving the service order (to be completed in house or outsourced to a vendor)

3. Complete the service order

4. Customer communication and pickup

## Identifying the risks

We created a table like this for our expense report project:

| **Risk** | **Risk level** | **Plan to reduce risk** |
|----------|----------------|-------------------------|
| We can't confidently move old service order data into the system since paper trail is incomplete. | Significant | Review invoice data to confirm service order completions |
| External user access to entering data could lead to incorrect gear being associated with a customer and missed service and sales opportunities | Significant | Engage the sales team to help customers enter the correct information into the system at the time of purchase or service check-in |
