The first step in using Microsoft Power Platform to solve a business problem is deciding what problem that you want to overcome.

The app that you'll create in these modules will be based on processes, problems, and challenges from a scuba shop's service department.

Before starting the process of solving a problem with a Microsoft Power Apps project, you'll need to determine if the project is worthwhile. Start with determining the cost of not solving the problem.

As a part of defining the business value that you hope to achieve from the Microsoft Power Platform solution, you should get a better understanding of what it's costing your organization to manually solve the problem.

It might be possible to approximate the high-level cost of solving the problem manually. You can express this estimation in the time that it takes to complete the process end-to-end. Alternatively, if you know a worker's complete cost (salary or hourly rate, benefits, and so on), you can multiply the time spent solving the problem by that rate to obtain a cost whenever the process is run. Then, if you know the number of times that the process is run, you can calculate the annual cost.

Not all projects will result in time or cost savings. Occasionally, automating a process can provide cleaner or more timely data, or it can help you maximize revenue. For example, capturing data allows for less time spent deciphering a trail of paper notes and more time in performing the service that customers are paying for.

Assuming that you've decided that this project is worth pursuing, the next step is to fully understand the current process and look for ways that you can optimize it.
