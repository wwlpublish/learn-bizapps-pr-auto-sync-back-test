The first step in using Microsoft Power Platform to solve a business problem is deciding what problem you want to tackle.

The app that we'll be creating in these modules will be based on processes, problems and challenges from a Scuba Shop's Service Department.

Remember that before you embark on "solving a problem" with a Power Apps project, you need to determine if the project is worthwhile. Start with understanding the cost of not solving the problem.

As a part of defining the business value that you hope to achieve from the Microsoft Power Platform solution, you should get a better understanding of what it's costing your organization to solve the problem in the current manner, manually.

It might be possible to "guesstimate" the high-level cost of solving the problem manually. This can be expressed in the time it takes to complete the process end-to-end. Or, if you know a worker's "fully loaded" cost (salary or hourly rate, benefits, and so on), you can multiply the time spent solving the problem by that rate to get to a cost each time the process is run. From there, if you know the number of times the process is run, you can calculate the annual cost.

Not all projects result in time or cost savings. Sometimes automating a process can provide cleaner or more timely data, or maximize revenue. For example, capturing data allows for less time spent deciphering a trail of paper notes and more time performing the service customers are paying for.

Assuming you've decided this project is worth pursuing, the next step is to fully understand the current process and look for optimizations you can make to it.
