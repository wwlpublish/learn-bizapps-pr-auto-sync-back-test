Adjusting any area of your deployment strategy could seem overwhelming. This unit discusses three essential change management concepts you should consider as you look to improve your continuous deployment process.

## Break down silos and build empathy

Why is it so hard to overcome organizational inertia?

- When we work with teams that are resistant to change, it often takes time to build trust between teams and departments. People also need evidence that the changes will be beneficial. The people who are pushing the change also need to make it easy for those adopting the change to do the right thing.

- People who work in change management tend to be rational and detail oriented.

- They tend to respond well to bound experiments in low-risk environments.

## Create feedback loops

- Feedback loops should cover not only sentiment from IT teams, but also include the introduction of new capabilities.

- If there's a separate change management team, involve them in the process early to collaborate and help shape designs.

## Measure the impact of your new approach

- Make your success visible
