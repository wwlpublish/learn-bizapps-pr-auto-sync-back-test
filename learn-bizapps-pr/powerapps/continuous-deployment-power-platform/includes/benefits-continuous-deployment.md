The top benefits of continuous deployment are:

- Encourages configuration as code

- Minimizes the time to deploy

- Enables automated testing throughout the pipeline

- Makes deploying to production a low-stress activity

- Provides visibility and feedback cycles

- Reduces time to mitigate incidents (TTM)

- Reduces time to remediate incidents (TTR)

- With a faster release cadence, hotfixes can become part of the normal release cycle

Next, let's look at an example of a continuous deployment workflow.
