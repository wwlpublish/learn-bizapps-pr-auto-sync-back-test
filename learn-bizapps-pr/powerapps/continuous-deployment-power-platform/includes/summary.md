A healthy deployment process is essential to have a successful ALM for the Power Platform. Here are a few questions to assess the health of your continuous deployment process:

- Are you shipping managed solutions?

- Is production being serviced while you work on v-next?

- Are you testing post-deployment? (Smoke test, UI test, etc.)

For more information about continuous deployment, see [CI/CD for Azure Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/azure-devops-continuous-integration-for-power-platform/?azure-portal=true).
