This module explored the features of both the address input and interactive map control. The use cases and configuration options of the address input were discussed as well as what output properties you could use to further enhance your canvas app. The use cases and configuration options of the interactive map were discussed, and the properties that could be set from the canvas app designer or within the canvas app itself through formulas. You were able to view a working example of both controls working together within a canvas app. The map control in this example had a data source where users could view locations, and add locations of their own. Users could also view data associated with each pin. Finally, other geolocational features that can be used with a map control were explained for the user to research further upon completion of this module.
