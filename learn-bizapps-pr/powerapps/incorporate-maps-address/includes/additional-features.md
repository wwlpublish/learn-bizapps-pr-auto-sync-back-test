Additionally, more advanced features can be used with map information. These are especially helpful to include when the interactive map is being used while on a mobile device.

As you learned earlier in the map feature, you can use the Location function in the latitude and longitude to get the location of the current user through the **Location.Latitude** and **Location.Longitude** variables in the application.

There are also options for providing information about the user's acceleration, compass direction (which direction the user is heading), and current altitude. These are called signals and can be helpful when used with a map control to provide more context to the user's location. For more information, see the documentation [Acceleration, App, Compass, Connection, and Location signals in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/signals/?azure-portal=true).

For an example of these other controls being used in a canvas app, refer to the documentation [Create an app that uses mobile sensors](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/how-to/mobile-sensors/?azure-portal=true).
