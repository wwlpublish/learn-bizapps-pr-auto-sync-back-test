After you've selected a layout, the page will appear on the canvas and the webpage properties will be available to edit in the Properties pane. The maker can define the webpage name, partial URL, and template.

Then, the maker can begin to add and edit components to the webpage.

After saving the webpage, a maker has the following options that they can use to organize where and how the page is organized in the portal site map. By selecting pages from the toolbelt, the maker can select the particular page and then perform the actions that are described in the following table.
