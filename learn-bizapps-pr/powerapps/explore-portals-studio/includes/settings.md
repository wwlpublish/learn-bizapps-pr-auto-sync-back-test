## Table permissions

Site administrators can control access to specific pages using content authorization. However, they'll also want to secure custom web applications built with basic forms and lists. To secure these features, table permissions allow granular rights to be granted.

To access table permissions page in Power Apps portal Studio select **Settings** icon on the toolbelt and then select **Table permissions**

This will open a new window where table permissions can be created and managed, and have the web roles assigned to them.

## Progressive web application

Power Apps portals now support progressive web app (PWA) technology that enables creating an app that will work on all platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, and Chromebooks) and form factors (mobile, desktop, and tablet).

PWAs are built to provide users a native app–like experience. These apps can be installed from the browser or through app stores. This capability enables external and internal customers to use a portal as an app. 

To configure the portal as a PWA select **PWA** icon on the toolbelt then select **Enable PWA** toggle.

On that screen you can configure various PWA properties including its appearance on the mobile devices and offline behavior.
