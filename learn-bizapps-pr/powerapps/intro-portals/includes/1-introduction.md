Power Apps portals come with various preconfigured portal solutions that target diverse audiences such as communities, customers, partners, and employees. Starter portals have many features that add value to Power Apps and Microsoft Dynamics 365 service apps. The following sections explain how these features help modern businesses engage a modern audience.

## Modern audience

Portal capabilities empower most online customers who prefer to find answers on their own through self-service and community options. By using Power Apps portals, you can provide them with a branded, personalized, self-service experience. Portals help you provide an organized, searchable knowledge base to deliver consistent, up-to-date answers and community experience for peer-to-peer support and direct interaction with your subject matter experts. Additionally, portals provide simple navigation with seamless transitions between self and assisted support.

Out-of-the-box mobile optimizations for portal and knowledge articles ensure that customers can get the help that they need, anytime and from any device. 

Providing a web portal interface takes advantage of these user trends and brings any type of engagement, including partner, group, and employee scenarios, that directly access Dataverse to create a modern connected experience for external users and internal business operations.

## Modern business

Your business is already using Power Apps. Consider the other capabilities that Power Apps portals can enable: 

- **Provide self-service support** - Add self-service capabilities to your website so that your customers can search knowledge articles, engage with other customers, find answers, and create support cases when needed (that go directly into Dynamics 365 Customer Service), all without a single interaction from your resources.

- **Build a sales pipeline** - When a lead fills out a **Contact us** form on your company website, this information is recorded in Dynamics 365 Sales where the record can become part of your sales pipeline automatically.

- **Empower employees** - When an employee needs a new computer, they can fill out an online form, where the information will be recorded in Dataverse so the helpdesk staff can immediately access and process this information.

- **Engage mobile workforce** - Empower agents on any device, wherever they work. Field technicians can process and complete work orders in the field, instantly updating Dynamics 365 Field Service.

## Power Apps portals capabilities

Power Apps portals are built on top of Dataverse. This architecture comes with a major benefit. All the differentiating features of Dataverse are the features of Power Apps portals as well, including:

- Centralized administration, management, and monitoring

- Rich metadata and Common Data Model

- Comprehensive security and audit

- Declarative forms and views

- Business logic, validation, and process automation

- Dataverse extensibility and integration with other services

Power Apps portals deliver a complete content management system out of the box, with all content stored in Dataverse. As a result, content can be edited through the Power Apps portals Studio and also directly by using the Portal Management app.

The following table describes the key capabilities of Power Apps portals.

Integrate portals with other systems like SharePoint or Power BI. Extend portals with pro development to cater to complex scenarios. |

Power Apps portals extend this model to help secure and tailor the content for the external and internal target audiences who aren't Power Apps users. |
