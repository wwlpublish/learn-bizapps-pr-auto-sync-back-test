Power Apps portals is a low-code solution for building business web sites. For complex requirements, advanced makers and pro developers can extend a Power Apps portal in several ways.

## Liquid

Liquid is an open-source markup language that can be embedded into content (webpages content, content snippets) and web templates.  Liquid is used to add dynamic content to webpages and can also be used to surface Microsoft Dataverse rows dynamically.

For more information, see [Work with Liquid templates](/power-apps/maker/portals/liquid/liquid-overview/?azure-portal=true).

## Web templates

Portals are provisioned with a predefined set of web templates that define how a webpage is structured. Makers can modify or create new web templates to address specific requirements. For example, a web template can be created to display static and dynamic content in a specific layout.

For more information, see [Create a custom page template](/power-apps/maker/portals/liquid/create-custom-template/?azure-portal=true).

## JavaScript

Custom JavaScript code can be embedded in different portal assets such as webpages, web templates, forms, and lists.  JavaScript can be used to enhance the client interface, add complex user input validation, call external web services, or call Dataverse directly using portals Web API. 

> [!NOTE]
> Scripting in Power Apps portals is specific to portal components and does not use scripts from model-driven apps in forms or views.

For more information, see [Add custom JavaScript](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/add-custom-javascript/?azure-portal=true).

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to control the appearance and the behavior of portal webpages. CSS can also implement specific portal features instead of JavaScript code, for example, to hide certain page elements.
