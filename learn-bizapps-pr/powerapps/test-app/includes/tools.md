The following tools help you test model-driven apps. 

## EasyRepro

EasyRepro is the tool provided for Dynamics 365 and Power Apps model-driven apps. It not only includes a testing tool but also has over 200 sample test cases to help you speed up the testing process.

For more information, see the blog post [EasyRepro automated testing framework](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/easyrepro-automated-testing-framework-june-update-is-now-available/?azure-portal=true), and access it at the [EasyRepro GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/EasyRepro/?azure-portal=true).

## Solution checker

The solution checker is a tool that allows you to perform a rich static analysis check on your solutions against a set of best practice rules and quickly identify these problematic patterns.

The solution checker analyzes these solution components:

-   Dataverse custom workflow activities

-   Dataverse web resources (HTML and JavaScript)

-   Dataverse configurations, such as SDK message steps

After the check completes, you receive a detailed report that lists the issues identified, the components and code affected, and links to documentation that describes how to resolve each issue.

For more information, see, [Use solution checker to validate your model-driven apps in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/use-powerapps-checker/?azure-portal=true).

The following tools help you test canvas apps.

## Power Apps Test Studio (experimental)

For testing inside canvas apps, you can use a built-in tool named Power Apps Test Studio to write, organize, and automate tests for canvas apps.

For more information, see, [Test Studio (experimental)](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/test-studio/?azure-portal=true).

## Azure Monitor (experimental)

When you're testing for performance issues, you can use Monitor to check network activity, similar to a network trace in the browser.

For details about the Monitor tool, see the blog post [Introducing Monitor to debug apps and improve performance](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-monitor-to-debug-apps-and-improve-performance/?azure-portal=true).
