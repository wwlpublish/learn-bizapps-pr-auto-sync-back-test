For this exercise, we'll test our solution to validate our apps in Power Apps. The solution checker will analyze custom workflow activities, web resources, and all Dataverse configurations, such as SDK message steps.

1.  On the left pane, select **Solutions**, then select the **Dive Center App** Solution we created in module 3, select to drop the **Solution Checker menu**, select **Run**.
