Basic Forms add the ability for portal pages to interact with rows in a specific table by using a model-driven form definition as a layout template. Similar to table lists, basic forms are data-driven configurations that allow users to add a form to collect or display data in the portal without the need for a developer to create a custom form. Basic forms are defined by using model-driven forms and can be placed into webpages in the portal.

Basic forms can display most column types and subgrids, choices column type (see [Configure a choices column for portals](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/choices-column/?azure-portal=true)) and code components (see [Use code components in portals](/power-apps/maker/portals/component-framework/?azure-portal=true)).

## Common uses

The following table explains the common scenarios where basic forms can be used.

| Scenario | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Layout** | Basic forms can be configured and used in read-only mode as a layout mechanism. Think of basic forms as informational pages about employees, products, or any other Microsoft Dataverse table. For example, you might have a custom table in your Dataverse instance that describes open positions that are available within your organization. Instead of crafting a special template to render the page, you can create a separate model-driven form for the table, create a new webpage by using portals Studio, and then add a **Basic Form** component to the page. Any published changes in a form layout in a model-driven app will automatically apply to the webpage. |
| **Information capture** | Forms can be used on the portal for data capture from anonymous or authenticated users. For example, a simple lead basic form might be rendered on a **Contact Us** page to record anonymous requests as leads in Dynamics 365 Sales. For authenticated users, a portal might use a survey page to collect product feedback from customers into a custom Product Feedback table. |
| **Record management** | Typically used in authenticated scenarios, basic forms allow various combinations of Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a table to be defined within a set of related webpages. For example, customers can retrieve and read their own cases and create new ones, partners can edit their company profiles, and employees can view the list of assets that are allocated to them by the company. |
| **Web apps** | Basic forms, when used with table lists and subgrids, and with the functionality extended by JavaScript, allow developers to build complete web applications. |

## Create a basic form

When creating a new basic form, your first step is to decide the **Table** and **Form Name** that you'll be rendering. 

While reuse of forms that are part of a model-driven app is possible, the common practice is to design portal-specific model-driven forms (that might or might not be included in the model-driven apps).

- Portal forms are more concise with less information presented, especially when external audiences are involved.
- Portal processes are separate from the internal use of a staff-facing, model-driven app (including Dynamics 365 apps). Dedicated portal forms are easier to maintain because any changes in the model-driven apps need to be manually applied to the portal forms, giving you an opportunity to review the requirements and assess usability aspects.
- Certain limitations exist on the form and columns that are rendering. For more information, see [About basic forms](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/entity-forms/?azure-portal=true).
- Client-side business rules and JavaScript, which are essential parts of a model-driven form, won't run on the portal. It's easy to overlook and might result in unintended consequences. 
- Special considerations need to be given when you're rendering related rows, notes, and a timeline because not all functional aspects are supported (or required) in the portals.

### Mode

The form mode can be **Read Only**, **Insert**, or **Edit**. This mode defines if the form is used to generate a layout, capture the data, or provide full editing capabilities for Dataverse rows. 

> [!NOTE]
> A form that is in **Edit** mode will be rendered as **Read Only** if the user does not have write privileges for the row.

If the mode is **Insert**, no additional information is required. For **Read Only** and **Edit** modes, the form will need to "know" the table row to display and update. The **Record Source Type** setting defines how this information is passed to the form:

- **Query String** - This setting is default when you're creating a basic form in portals Studio. When the page that contains the form is displayed, the row identifier is expected to be part of the query string, for example `https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/contacts/edit/?id=<contact guid>`. Usually, this setting is done automatically when the form is linked to a table list. This setting is by far the most common. 
- **Current Portal User** - This option is configured within the Portal Management app. When this option is selected, the form will load the information from the current portal user row without using additional information from the page URL. Commonly, this option is used to render a user profile form. The **Table Name** column in this case must be set to **Contact** because portal users are represented by the contact table.
- **Record Associated to Current Portal User** - This option is configured within the Portal Management app. Selecting this option allows you to edit associated rows, such as the current user's parent account details. **Relationship Name** must be specified to identify the row to edit. The table type that is selected must match the selection in the **Table Name** column. This option is useful in partner scenarios where the partner organization would have multiple portal users. Some of these users could be authorized to edit the parent account row.

**Table**, **Form**, and **Mode** are the details that are required to render the form.

## Configure the basic form

More configuration options to control form appearance and behavior are available within portals Studio.

> [![Screenshot of the Table Form configuration with Form success settings.](../media/3-entity-form-settings-ssm.png)](../media/3-entity-form-settings-ssm.png#lightbox)

### Form success settings

The form success settings determine the actions that are taken when a form is successfully submitted to a portal.

- **Show success message** - Shows a message when a form is submitted.
- **Redirect to webpage** - Automatically navigates to a webpage on success of the form submission.
- **Redirect to URL** - Redirects to a URL (portal or external).

### Advanced settings

The **Advanced settings** feature determines if a captcha is displayed for anonymous or authenticated users. 

## Additional basic form settings

More configuration settings are available for basic forms in the Portal Management app. To access a basic form in the Portal Management app:

1. Go to the [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true).
1. Select the target environment by using the environment selector in the upper-right corner.
1. From the **Apps** list, locate and open the Portal Management app (type will be Model-driven).
1. Select **Basic Forms** in the left navigation.
1. Open the form that you previously created in portals Studio.

### Configuration

The following sections describe the different ways that you can configure basic forms.

#### Form options

Most form options support customization of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) elements to change visual appearance. Text elements such as labels, messages, and tooltips can be specified in multiple languages. For example, the default message after the form submission is "Saved," but it can be customized for each of the enabled portal languages.

Another form option includes **Control validation behavior**, where you can determine whether to mark all columns as required regardless of the form setting, for example.

#### Additional settings

More settings define other aspects of form behavior, such as styling, translation of the UI elements, and so on. 

> [!TIP]
> Some of the settings and configuration options are hidden. Select the **Advanced settings** check box to display all available options.

**Associate current portal user on insert** - This option can be used to keep track of which portal contacts created or updated the row. This setting creates a portal equivalent of the **Created By** and **Modified By** columns in Dataverse. You can also set parental relationships where applicable. For example, if a new account row is created, you might want to set the current contact as a primary contact automatically.

**Add attach file** - Many options are available to add a file upload control to your form. Configuration is flexible and supports multiple files, storage options, mime type, and size restrictions (for example, you can restrict uploads to images up to 2 MB in size). 

**Geolocation** - A basic form can be configured to display a map control to display an existing location as a pin on a map or to provide a user with the ability to specify a location. For more information, see [Add Geolocation](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/add-geolocation/?azure-portal=true).

The form's map control requires other configuration to tell it what the various location columns are, to assign values to them, or retrieve values from them. For more information, see [Geolocation configuration for basic forms](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/add-geolocation/?azure-portal=true).

> [![Screenshot of the Table form with geolocation enabled.](../media/3-entity-form-geolocation-ss.png)](../media/3-entity-form-geolocation-ss.png#lightbox)

#### Table reference

**Table reference** provides a way to associate the current row that is being created or updated with another target row. This feature is useful if you have multiple steps with multiple table types and want to relate the resulting rows or if the page is passed in a query string of a row ID that you want to associate. 

For example, you might have an event page that displays information about an upcoming webinar. You want to include a registration button that redirects visitors to the registration page where the registration form is displayed. You can pass the event identifier in a query string and, when the registration form is submitted, you'll be able to automatically link the registration information to the event.

### Actions

Because a basic form deals with an individual table row, numerous actions can be run against this row, such as Update, Delete, Deactivate, and so on. These actions, that at runtime are displayed as command buttons, can be configured by selecting **Additional Settings > Action Button Configuration**. 

All commands include options to rename the buttons and change their placement on the form. 

### Table form metadata

**Table form metadata** rows allow you to control the appearance and behavior of individual form elements, including:

- Appearance of the columns, sections, and tabs. An individual column's default values, validation behavior, and other aspects can be defined.
- Subgrids configuration, which allows you to define actions for related rows, similar to table list actions.
- Behavior of notes and timeline sections, and if new rows can be added. This option is commonly used to allow portal users to enter comments about the row, for example, a case in process.

## Add a basic form to your portal

A basic form defines the required behavior but doesn't contain information about how and where on the site that the form should be rendered. Two methods to render a basic form in a portal are:

- The basic form can be explicitly specified as a target for a table list action like Create, Update, or Edit. In this case, the form will be rendered in a modal pop-up window. Certain limitations apply when the form is rendered in a pop-up window, for example, the ability to create related rows from subgrids isn't available.
- Similar to a table list, a basic form component can be added to a webpage from portals Studio. This action will place a Liquid tag on the webpage copy to render the basic form.

```twig
{% entityform name: '<<form name>>' %}
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Table form code editor liquid tag.](../media/3-entity-form-liquid-tag-ssm.png)](../media/3-entity-form-liquid-tag-ssm.png#lightbox)

Because forms can submit information back to the server for processing, you'll have less control over the rendering of basic forms as compared to the lists.

The following video shows how to extend table list functionality with basic forms and display a Dataverse row in a pop-up window or on a separate webpage.
