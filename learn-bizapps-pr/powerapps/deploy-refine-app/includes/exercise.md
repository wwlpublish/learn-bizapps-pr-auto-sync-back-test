1. Choose **+** to add a tab.

1. In the **Add a tab** dialog box, choose **Power Apps**.

## Known issues

In the desktop app for Microsoft Teams:

- Apps must load content such as images and .pdf files over a secure (https) connection.

- Not all sensors, such as **Acceleration**, **Compass**, and **Location**, are supported.

- Only these audio formats are supported: AAC, H264, OGG Vorbis, and WAV.

## Clean up resources

To remove the app from the channel, choose the **Product Showcase** tab > **Remove**.
