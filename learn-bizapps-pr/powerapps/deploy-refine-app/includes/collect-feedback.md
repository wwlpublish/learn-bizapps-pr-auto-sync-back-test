Solution Architects love implementing apps that are adopted and used by the users they were intended for. However, tracking what users are using within these apps can be challenging. Apps can be connected with Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor. Application Insights includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app.

With your app connected to Applications Insights, you can collect information to help you drive better business decisions and improve the quality of your apps.
