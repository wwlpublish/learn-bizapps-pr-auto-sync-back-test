AI Builder offers a guided experience that walks you through each step of the experience and allows you to create a custom model by following a few simple steps.

## Select a custom model

Sign in to either Power Apps Studio or Power Automate Studio and then select **AI Builder** > **Explore** in the left navigation pane.

In the list of available models, you can identify custom models by a tag included in the tile that describes the model type and title.

## Create a custom model

After you select a custom model, AI Builder guides you through the process of creation.

If you're creating your first model for the selected type or need to review the steps to create and use it, a link to the official documentation is provided.

Make sure that you have everything you need to create your model. You can also use [sample data](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/samples/?azure-portal=true) to create any of these models. When you're ready, select the **Get started** button and follow the guided steps that are specific to the selected model.

## Follow the guided experience

Every model type has its own set of steps to create a model. In the following video, you walk through the steps to train and publish a custom model, in this case *Category Classification.*

## Publish your model

Allow the training to complete. When you determine the performance level of your custom model to be at an adequate level for your business scenario, you can publish this model to make it available for the applicable Microsoft Power Platform tools.

You now have learned how to create a custom model. Next, you'll learn how to add a prebuilt model component to a model-driven app.
