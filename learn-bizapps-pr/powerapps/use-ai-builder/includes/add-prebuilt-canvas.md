AI Builder prebuilt model components can provide a rich user experience in your applications. One type of Power Apps app where you can include these components is a canvas app. For this unit, you'll learn about the *business card reader* that allows business card detection and extracts their information.

## Add the business card reader

The business card reader component is added to a canvas screen by following these steps:

1. In the top menu for a selected screen in the canvas app studio, select the **Insert** tab.

1. In the AI Builder group, select **Business card reader**.

## Configure the business card reader

After you select the business card reader component you want to add to the screen, you need to capture the results of the reader. To capture these results, you need to configure input fields on a form or labels on the screen and link them to the business card reader values.

In the following video, you walk through the configuration steps by using a form with a Microsoft Dataverse table that captures the information on a contact record.
