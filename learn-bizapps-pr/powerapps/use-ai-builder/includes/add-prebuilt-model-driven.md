AI Builder prebuilt model components can provide a rich user experience in your applications. One type of Power Apps app where you can include these components is a model-driven app. In this unit, you'll learn about the *business card reader* that allows business card detection and extracts their information.

## Add the business card reader

The business card reader component is added to a model-driven form by following these steps:

1. In the left navigation pane of the model-driven form studio, for a selected form, under the Components section, expand **Input**.

1. In the **Input** group, select **AI Builder Business Card control**.

## Configure the business card reader

After you select the business card reader component you want to add to the form, you need to configure which table columns will serve as placeholders for the values detected from the business card. A text input column is also required as a placeholder for the component itself. No value will update this column, so even if the text input column is used elsewhere on the form, it's only to position the column on the form.

## Test the business card reader

In this video, you walk through the configuration steps, and how you can test the component in your model-driven app.

You now have learned how to add a prebuilt model component to a model-driven app. Next, you'll learn how to add the same type of component to a canvas app.
