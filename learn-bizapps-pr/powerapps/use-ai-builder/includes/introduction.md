Welcome to AI Builder models in Microsoft Power Apps. This self-paced module will help you learn the differences between custom and prebuilt AI Builder models and allow you to determine which type suits your business objective in Power Apps.

## AI Builder prebuilt models

Prebuilt models are based on AI data and patterns that Microsoft has introduced in their training. These ready-to-use models cover broadly available data and concepts that aren't specific to your organization or scenario.

Examples of available prebuilt models are:

- Business card reader

- ID reader

- Key phrase extraction

- Language detection

- Receipt processing

- Sentiment analysis

- Text recognition

- Text translation

## AI Builder custom models

Custom models require training and validation before they can be used in Power Apps or Microsoft Power Automate. They cover scenarios that are specific to your organization.

Examples of available custom models are:

- Prediction

- Object detection

- Category classification

- Form processing

## AI Builder models available as prebuilt and custom

AI Builder provides one model that is available in both prebuilt and custom forms: **entity extraction**.

You should evaluate each model based on industry data to determine whether a model responds to your business scenario or requires you to train a custom model based on your organization historical data.

You now have learned the fundamentals of AI Builder models. Next, you'll learn how to create a new custom model.
