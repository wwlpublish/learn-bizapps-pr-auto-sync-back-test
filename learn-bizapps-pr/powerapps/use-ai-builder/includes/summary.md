In this module, you learned about the AI Builder models in Power Apps.

Through the different units, you learned how to differentiate prebuilt models and custom models.

Learned concepts:

- Prebuilt models are ready to go but aren't specific to your organization's data.

- Custom models require training based on data you provide that suits the targeted business scenario.

- Custom models must be published before they can be used in Power Apps or Power Automate.

- Some models offer both types, custom and prebuilt, which allows you to address ready-to-go and customized scenarios.
