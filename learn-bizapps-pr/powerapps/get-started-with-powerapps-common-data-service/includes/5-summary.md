Congratulations on using Microsoft Dataverse, and creating your first tables! 

Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. This data is usable across the Power Platform. Standard and custom tables within Dataverse provide a secure and cloud-based storage option for your data.

Let's review what you've learned:
- Dataverse stores data in tables. 
- If you can, it's preferable to use as many default tables as possible, so that your system is easy to maintain.
- Creating new tables is easy.
- Data can be added into a table from the *Tables* screen, either by manually inputting it or importing from a variety different sources.
