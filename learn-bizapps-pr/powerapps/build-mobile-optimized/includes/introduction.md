Users can interact with a Power Apps canvas app in many different ways, devices, and locations. Some users use a desktop computer to access the canvas app through a web browser with a full keyboard and mouse, whereas others might use a tablet or phone.

On a phone or tablet, the user interacts with the canvas without the aid of peripherals like keyboards and a mouse on a device that is in a single, consistent location. The users instead use their fingers and hands to interact with the device that moves between multiple locations. A mobile-optimized canvas app should take those variables into consideration in its design.

Too often a person creating a canvas app gathers requirements for a canvas app, creates the application, and then deploys the application for users to interact with. Considerations for the app interaction design are usually an afterthought. The Power Apps creation environment doesn't always provide the same conditions as the environment the canvas app will be used in.

The following animation quickly demonstrates how a desktop or tablet experience doesn't always translate to a good mobile phone experience that has the same layout. Special design considerations must be considered for the best user experience.

In this module, we'll review the different design considerations for designers to create a canvas app that is optimized for the mobile experience.
