This module explored how to design and create a mobile-optimized canvas app. By understanding what the definition of mobile-optimized means, you can identify the design factors to consider in creating your application based on your specific business use cases. You learned about the benefits of a responsive design when building a canvas app from a blank template. The different configurations and controls that contribute to a mobile-optimized experience were also reviewed as they impact the final design of a canvas app. For a finished app, you can evaluate the performance of your application to make sure it's performing at a level that is acceptable for users and adjust the design based on different performance tuning techniques.
