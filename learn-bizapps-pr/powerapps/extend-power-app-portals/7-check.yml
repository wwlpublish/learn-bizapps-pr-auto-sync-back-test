  - content: You have a requirement to set a default value on basic form and also to hide the column. What is the most efficient method to complete the task?
    choices: 
    - content: Use business rules on the model-driven form.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Business rules on the model-driven form will not apply to the portal. A JavaScript function would work, but it is not the most efficient method. Hiding the column on the form designer will not set the default value. An Table Form Metadata record has the ability to set a default value and hide the column by using the CSS class value of "hide."

  - content: You need to apply different background color to all pages in the `/products` section of your Power Apps portal. How would you accomplish this task? 
    choices: 
    - content: Add JavaScript to the portal that would use page URL to dynamically modify page styles.
      isCorrect: false
