Power Apps portals provides webpage access security by creating a **Web Page Access Control Rule** record for a specific webpage. To provide portal users access to a Microsoft Dataverse table, a **Table Permission** row is created. Both the **Web Page Access Control Rule** row and the **Table Permission** row can be associated with a **Web Role** row, which can be associated with a Dataverse contact row. When a Dataverse contact is an authenticated portal user, the permissions and access will determine which pages and data they can view and interact with.

This module explained the following concepts:

- The relationship between a Dataverse contact table and a portal user.

- The **Web Role** row and how it is used in portal security.

- Restricting access to webpages by using webpage access control rules.

- Restricting or providing access to Dataverse on portal webpages by using table permissions.

- Configuring a security model in a Power Apps portal.
