  A model-driven app is a powerful app development tool within the Microsoft Power Platform. Model-driven apps can build enterprise applications that run on user desktops or mobile devices. A form is an important component of a model-driven app. Forms function as an interface between the user and data stored in Microsoft Dataverse. Forms consist of controls, data, and business logic. Apart from regular controls, there are specialized controls to perform some typical business requirements.
