  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)]
  A model-driven app is a powerful app development tool within Microsoft Power Platform. Model-driven apps can build enterprise applications that run on user desktops or mobile devices. A form is an important component of a model-driven app. Forms function as an interface between the user and data that's stored in Microsoft Dataverse. Forms consist of controls, data, and business logic. Apart from regular controls, specialized controls are available to help you complete typical business requirements.
