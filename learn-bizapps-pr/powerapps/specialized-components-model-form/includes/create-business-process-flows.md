The business process flow is a component of Microsoft Power Platform model-driven apps. These flows can guide users to execute sequential work. A business process flow can streamline the processes of the organization. The streamlined process provides a seamless user experience that leads to a conclusive interaction aligning with the organizational goal. This user experience can be tailored so that people with different security roles can have access that fits their need.

Business process flows ensure that data entry consistently follows the same steps every time users work in the same business process. Business process flows can define a set of steps that users follow to get the desired outcome. These steps can visually indicate the stage of the business process in which the user is presently working. Business process flows reduce the training need, because the process itself can guide users. For example, you can configure business process flows to support common sales methodologies that can help your sales groups achieve better results.

## User interface of a business process flow

In a business process flow, you can define set of stages and steps. Each stage contains a group of steps. Each step represents a field where data can be entered. Users advance to the next stage by selecting the **Next Stage** button. Steps can also be required so that users must enter data for the corresponding field before they can proceed to the next stage. This is commonly called stage-gating.

Business process flows can be applied on the form fields. Business rules or form scripts are automatically applied to the fields used in the business process flows. Steps can be added that set values for fields that aren't present in the form by using form scripts. Any workflows that are initiated by changes to fields included in a business process flow will be applied when the data in the form is saved.
