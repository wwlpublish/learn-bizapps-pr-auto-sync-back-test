  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.
  questions:
  - content: Joanne, a care service supervisor, has been processing patient post-visit surveys to ensure that the quality of provided service is satisfactory. The category classification model that Joanne trained and published has been performing efficiently for the first month of implementation. Lately, a degradation is noticed where some of the surveys are processed with the wrong tags or missing key tags. What should you recommend to Joanne to rectify the situation quickly?
    choices:
    - content: Modify the flow that processes the feedback to retrain the model as new values are processed.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. There's no option from Power Automate to retrain a custom category classification model.
    - content: Create a new model based on the recent surveys analyzed and update the flow that processes the feedback.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although this is a valid option, the steps involved in creating a new model and modifying the processing flow aren't efficient for this scenario.
    - content: Navigate to the existing model and select the retrain option so it updates based on recent updated outcomes.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The retrain option will refresh the model prediction system with up-to-date information that is in the applicable tables.
  - content: Michael tries to create a custom category classification model based on emails stored in Microsoft SharePoint. They aren't able to select the list that contains those messages. What should Michael do to rectify this situation?
    choices:
    - content: Enable AI Builder synchronization in the SharePoint list.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. No option allows this type of synchronization.
    - content: Migrate the messages from SharePoint to Dataverse.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. AI Builder category classification requires data to be in Dataverse. In this scenario, to allow message processing, the messages must be migrated in a Dataverse table.
    - content: Modify the AI Builder configuration to connect to SharePoint.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. No option allows this type of configuration.
  - content: Julian needs to set up a category classification model to process supplier feedback for a logistics management company. A set of historical comments is available in Dataverse. What is the recommended option for Julian to prepare the data for training the custom model?
    choices:
    - content: List the categories to classify the comments in a new column of text data type in the Dataverse table.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The tags and the text must be in the same table and row in Dataverse.
    - content: Create a table to store the categories and create a relationship with the comments table.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. It's not possible to use a related table for the tags.
    - content: Add a lookup column to the Dataverse table that provides a selection from a list of categories.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The tags can't be a lookup value.
