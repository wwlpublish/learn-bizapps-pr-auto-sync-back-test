AI Builder category classification provides organizations with a tool that analyzes text and helps determine the different subjects it relates to and that can support automation processes. Multiple scenarios can benefit from this classification.

## First scenario: Customer reviews

A rental cottage owner posts pictures and services that are available for short-term renters on multiple social media channels. When vacationers check out after their stays, the cottage owner invites them to also post pictures and comments on the property's website.

The cottage owner notices that even with the link provided, many customers leave reviews on different channels than the website. Wanting to build a positive reputation, based on the highest possible number of customer reviews, they create an automated process that monitors the most visible social media sites and vacation review forums and captures all the posts that relate to the rental property.

Messages are then categorized. The categories allow them to filter on those that are considered compliments. When reviewed, they add the references on their website where new potential visitors have visibility on the positive references.

## Second scenario: Forum moderation

A community forum moderator has received complaints for messages that are intended for a mature audience. The messages should be classified clearly so visitors get warning notifications when they navigate to such message threads.

When messages are originally posted, they're put in a verification queue. The categorization of the text helps determine when an extra warning should be included with the message once published in the forum.

## Third scenario: 360 employee feedback

In a competitive market where employee satisfaction is a key influencer to maintain a high retention level, a telecom corporation is promoting a praise station where employees, managers, and customers can anonymously submit feedback about their experience with different members of the staff they interact with.

The human resources (HR) department responsible for this initiative has tested the praise station at only a few retail locations and local offices, and has concluded that the high level of participation would require an automated processing of the messages before launching this initiative nationwide.

The HR department classifies the reviews in categories such as **issues**, **complaints**, and **bad service**, so they can ensure that negative or prejudicial reviews don't get forwarded directly to the targeted employees and are analyzed by a supervisor.

You now have learned how different scenarios can be resolved by using AI Builder category classification. Next, you'll learn how to build a custom model and then use it in Microsoft Power Automate.
