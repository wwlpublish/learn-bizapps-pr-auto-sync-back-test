Microsoft Power Apps portals have a number of features such as lists, basic forms, and the ability to use Liquid template language that allows an app maker to build powerful web applications. However, you might encounter instances where you need to integrate your portal to web-based technologies to extend the scope of your application.

SharePoint document libraries can be added to basic forms to allow portal users to view and upload files that are related to a specific Microsoft Dataverse row.

Power BI reports and dashboards can be added and configured in Power Apps portals studio as components to portal pages to show rich visualizations of data.

Adding components such as lists, basic forms, and Microsoft Power BI will add the corresponding Liquid tags to a portal page. Liquid template language also has several Dataverse-specific tags that allow you to add items that don't appear as components, such as model-driven charts and advanced forms.

Using Chatbot component makers can add a Power Virtual Agents chatbot to answer questions asked by a visitor on your portals page. 

The iFrame component allows for the integration of other Microsoft technologies such as Microsoft Forms to quickly create surveys, quizzes, and polls, and even canvas Power Apps to add to a Power Apps portal page.

> [!NOTE]
> Users will still require appropriate licensing for specific technologies, such as licenses for embedded canvas Power Apps or access to Power BI reports.

Pro developers can also add JavaScript code to a page to securely access Dataverse using Portals Web API or to communicate with other applications and services using external REST APIs.

The next few units  examine how you can integrate Power Apps portals with some of these technologies.
