  Power Virtual Agents empowers subject matter experts to build intelligent conversational bots, using a guided, no-code graphical interface. Leveraging Power Automate, you can call flows from your chatbot topics, connecting your bot to other data sources, so that it can take action on behalf of the user.
  
  Power Virtual Agents is available as an app in Microsoft Teams, enabling you to create an internal chatbot. This is an ideal solution if you want to create a chatbot to answer common internal questions posed by employees, particularly for areas like IT and human resources where there are a lot of frequently asked questions.
