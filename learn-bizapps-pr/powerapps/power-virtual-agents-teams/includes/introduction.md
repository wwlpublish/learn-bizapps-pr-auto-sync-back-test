In this lab, we'll be adding the Power Virtual Agents app to Microsoft Teams and creating a chatbot for the employees of Contoso Coffee to get information about frequently asked questions for swag and to use the bot to request swag. The chatbot will be able to submit an asset request on behalf of the user, and you'll see the request in the same Dataverse for Teams table that you created in Lab 01. 

- **Exercise 1**: Create a chatbot in Teams- Explore the Power Virtual Agents app for Teams and create a bot.

- **Exercise 2**: Personalize the greeting. Edit the greeting topic to configure how the bot introduces itself to a user.

- **Exercise 3**: Create a topic. Create a topic for the bot to answer common questions from employees about Contoso Coffee’s swag.

- **Exercise 4**: Create a flow using the embedded flow experience. Set up the chatbot to interact with the Dataverse for Teams tables created in Lab 01 so that the user can submit a request for swag using the chatbot. To do this, we'll be using the embedded flow experience inside the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams.

- **Exercise 5**: Publishing and sharing your chatbot. Publish the bot so that it can be used by yourself, others in your Team and the organization.
