In this lab you created an internal chatbot embedded in Microsoft Teams, which is able to answer employee questions about Contoso Coffee swag and place orders on their behalf. You saw that the chatbot in Teams automatically recognizes the logged in user, and learned how to connect your chatbot to your Dataverse for Teams table to retrieve data and to create new requests on behalf of the user. Finally, you learned how to publish and share your bot with other team members, and how to request admin approval to publish your bot for the whole organization.
