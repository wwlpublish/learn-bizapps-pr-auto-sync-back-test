## Task 1: Discover and add the Power Virtual Agents app to Teams

4. You will now see the Power Virtual Agents app in the left-hand navigation bar. Right click on that icon and select **Pin**. This pins the app to the navigation bar, making it easier to return to it when you need to.

## Task 2: Create a new chatbot 

1. Select the **Start now** button.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting start now button.](../media/start-now.png)](../media/start-now.png#lightbox)

    You will be asked which team you want your bot to join. When you are adding a bot as an app in Teams, you can think of it as adding a new virtual member of your team. Select the dropdown and select the team you have used in the previous labs.

2. Once you have selected your team, select **continue**.

3. You will now be prompted to create a new bot. Give your bot a name (here we have used Office Helper). For this lab, you can make up your own bot name (or add your name to the end of the bot name – e.g. Office Helper – Jane) so that when we come to the collaboration exercise in Lab 6 the bots will have different names). 

4. Select create. Wait a minute or so until the bot has been provisioned. (Note the capability here to create a bot in other languages).

5. You are now seeing the familiar Power Virtual Agents builder inside Microsoft Teams. Your main navigation menu is on the left.

6. Select the hamburger icon to expand (or collapse) the navigation menu.

    > [![Screenshot highlighting hamburger icon.](../media/collapse.png)](../media/collapse.png#lightbox)

7. To the right of the Power Virtual Agents navigation menu, you will find the test pane. You will use this for testing your bot as you build it. You can hide or show this test pane selecting on the chatbot icon near the bottom left of the screen.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting chat space to type your message.](../media/test-bot-chat.png)](../media/test-bot-chat.png#lightbox)

8. The rest of the screen is the main canvas where you will be building your bot. As you work on topics, the authoring canvas will be displayed here. When you first create your bot (or when you navigate to the home screen), you’ll find guided help steps here to assist you with navigation and getting started.

## Task 3: Navigating between other parts of Teams and your existing chatbot

You can navigate away from building your chatbot to continue collaborating in Teams and come back to continue working on it at any time. Take note of this step – you will need to navigate back and forth later in the lab.

1. Select back on the main Teams icon in the left-hand navigation bar to return to your teams.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting left nvigation button.](../media/teams-left-navigation.png)](../media/teams-left-navigation.png#lightbox)

2. To return to building your chatbot, you need to return to the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams. If you pinned the icon to the navigation menu earlier, you will find it there and you can select it.  If not, you can select the   icon at the bottom of that menu, and search for Power Virtual Agents and select it.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting pinned icon.](../media/pinned-button.png)](../media/pinned-button.png#lightbox)

    **OR**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting search box.](../media/search-box.png)](../media/search-box.png#lightbox)

3. Select **Chatbots** in the menu at the top of your screen to see a list of all existing chatbots. Select the name of your chatbot to open it for editing.
