## Features

The Modern Community portal uses **Forums** and **Ideas** features of Power Apps portals that operate the same way as they do in other templates like Community or Employee Self-Service. The template adds a modernized look and feel to the portal site and extends standard functionality where users, in addition to providing feedback to organizations, the community can be used to collaborate on a social scale, and support suggestions from others to help shape the future of the products they use.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Community app simplifies administration and management of the site and provides community managers and moderators with the necessary capabilities to capture and evaluate ideas and demonstrate care with closed loop, applying their organization brand across user interaction points.
