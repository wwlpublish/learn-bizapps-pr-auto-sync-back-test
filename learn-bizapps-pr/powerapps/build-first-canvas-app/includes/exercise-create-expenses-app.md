You're ready to create your first app!

You probably have a bunch of questions right now, maybe you're still unsure if Power Apps has the functionality you specifically are looking for. That is exactly why it's the perfect time to create your first app. By getting in there and actually clicking the buttons, some of your questions will have answers.

Just think, in a few minutes you'll be able to call yourself an app creator. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

In this exercise, you'll create an Expenses App for mobile devices. To simplify things, this app will start from the "My Expenses" template. There are many templates to choose from, each one is pre-configured with different logic/functionality to support its use case. As a first-time app creator, taking some time to explore them further may help to spark ideas when you're creating custom apps.

Keep in mind that you can use data from many other sources, including Microsoft Dataverse, SharePoint, cloud services like Salesforce, and on-premises sources like Microsoft SQL Server.

Before you begin, watch this video for a brief overview of what to expect when creating your first Power App.

The following video will walk you through what the app is capable of, adding new items and editing existing.

## Create your first app

1.  Open your browser and go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true). When prompted to sign in and enter your organizational account credentials.

1.  From the **Home** screen, on the far right, select **More create options**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the more create options button.](../media/more-create-options.png)](../media/more-create-options.png#lightbox)

1.  In the **Search all templates** field, enter **Expenses**.

1.  Under **Start from template**, select **My Expenses**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the My expenses option under start from template.](../media/expenses.png)](../media/expenses.png#lightbox)

	> [!NOTE]
	> After the template has been selected, you can click **Preview** to test it out.

1.  For the **App name**, enter **My Expenses App** and select **Create**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the app name field with my expenses app entered and create button.](../media/create-expenses-app.png)](../media/create-expenses-app.png#lightbox)

After a few moments, you may get an "Almost there ..." pop up, select **Allow**.

1.  On the **Welcome to Power Apps Studio** pop up, select **Skip**.

As a best practice, once the app is created you should immediately **Save** your app. Power Apps has an AutoSave feature that will save your app every 2 minutes but doesn't start until the app has been saved for the first time.

1.  In the upper left, select **File**.

1.  It will already be on the **Save as** tab, name it **My Expenses** and select **Save** in the bottom right corner.

1.  Once the app is saved successfully, in the upper-left select the back arrow, to return to the app.

## Explore and edit your new app (explore the generated app)

Your My Expenses will open in the Power Apps Studio allowing you to review the various screens, controls, and functionality that make this app work.

If you want to play/preview the app, select the **Play** in the upper-right corner. When you're ready to get back into edit mode, select the X in the upper-right corner.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample app includes locally saved information using [collections](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection/?azure-portal=true). If you would like to use the app for business purposes, a data source would need to be created to mimic the existing collections. Then you would add the connection to this app.

Once you're done, you can close the app by going to **File** > **Close**. To view the app on your phone, you first need to install the Power Apps Mobile app.

## Install Power Apps (mobile) on your device

When building or updating an app, it's always a good idea to test it in the same form factor as the users. This app was designed for phone factor, so best practices would be to test it on a phone before putting the app into production.

1.  Download **Power Apps** **Mobile** from the app store, for the platform you want to use.

1.  Sign in, using your Office365 username and password.

1.  On your phone or tablet, run the **My Expenses app** in Power Apps Mobile. If you don't want to install the app, you can run it in a browser.

1.  If you don't see the **My Expenses** app in your Power Apps Mobile app, select the user account menu and toggle on **Show non-production apps**. You may need to swipe to the left or tap your profile icon to get this option.
