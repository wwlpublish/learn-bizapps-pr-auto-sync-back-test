Let's quickly recap what you learned in this module so you can continue your Power Apps journey. You've only dipped your toe in the endless possibilities for automation, simplification, and process improvement.

Power Apps is a low-code development platform with a suite of apps, services and connectors that you can use to quickly and easily build custom apps.

When creating, sharing, and administering your apps, you use [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), the Power Apps Studio, and the Power Apps Admin Center.

The power of Power Apps comes from the ability to connect to related technologies in your business without being a "coder". Examples of these are Microsoft Dataverse, Power Automate, Microsoft SharePoint, and other data sources.

There are multiple ways to create a new App. This includes from a template, a data source (like Microsoft SharePoint), or a blank canvas.
