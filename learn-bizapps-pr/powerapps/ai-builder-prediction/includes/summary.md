In this module, you learned about the AI Builder prediction model.

Through the different units, you learned how to prepare data to create and train the model. You also learned how to use the outcome of the model in a model-driven app.

Learned concepts:

-   What AI Builder prediction is and how it can apply to business scenarios

-   Three outcome patterns can be determined by AI Builder prediction:

    -   Binary prediction: a choice between two options

    -   Multiple outcome prediction: a choice from a predefined list of options

    -   Numerical prediction: when a question is answered with a number

-   How to prepare data and select columns that may influence the outcome prediction

-   How to create and train a prediction model

-   How to use the prediction model outcome in a model-driven app
