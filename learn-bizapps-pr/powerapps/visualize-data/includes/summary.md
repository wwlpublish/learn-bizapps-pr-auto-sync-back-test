In this module, you learned about the Dataverse table views.

Through the different units, you learned how to create new views to differentiate prebuilt models and custom models.

Learned concepts:

- Views can be used in Power Apps to limit the number of records listed and define the displayed columns.

- You can choose from three different view types:

  - Public

  - System

  - Personal

- Sort columns must be displayed in the view and can be sorted in ascending or descending order.

- Filters can be simple and complex using groups and Boolean And/Or conditions.
