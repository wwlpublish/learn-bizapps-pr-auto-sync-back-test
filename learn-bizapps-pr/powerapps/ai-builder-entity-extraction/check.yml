  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: A multinational retailer processes email messages that come into a centralized mailbox in different languages. She requests the creation of a flow that will extract recognized entities in those messages. Which statement is valid?
    choices: 
    - content: Entity extraction will automatically detect the language of the email messages.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Entity extraction doesn't detect the language of a message it processes.
    - content: Select the language from a list of available languages in the entity extraction action.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. A list of available languages is provided, and one must be selected for the action to be valid.
    - content: Entity extraction supports only English language messages or documents.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The entity extraction supports multiple languages.
  - content: A finance advisor department implements a solution that processes documents received from suppliers and customers and extracts the different recognized entities they relate to. Recently, the department noticed that many of the documents weren't processed by the Power Automate flow you created. Multiple failed runs are listed in the activity log. What could explain this issue?
    choices: 
    - content: The failed runs are for lengthy documents.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. If documents contain more than 5,000 characters, the entity extraction will generate an error and the flow will fail to run with success.
    - content: The flow is turned off, so the runs fail.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. If the flow is turned off, it will not run at all, so it will not have a failed run in the context of this scenario.
    - content: Processed documents are in French.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. French is one of the supported languages for entity extraction.
  - content: A petting zoo manager wants to identify animals that are included in email messages he receives so they can be routed to the proper specialized staff. In the list of supported entity types, animals aren't detected. What is the reason for the lack of detection?
    choices: 
    - content: A custom value must be added for the animal entity type.
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: Incorrect. Only two values can be configured in the entity extraction action, Language, and Text.
    - content: The prebuilt entity extraction model must be trained to recognize animal entity type.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. A prebuilt AI Builder model is to be used as is, no training is possible.
    - content: The prebuilt entity extraction model can't be customized, and new entity types can't be added.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. For this scenario, the prebuilt entity extraction can't process an unsupported entity type, such as animals. Review alternatives with other available AI Builder models.
