AI Builder entity extraction provides organizations with a classification of documents and messages based on a predetermined series of topics, such as email, person name, and temperature. Multiple businesses can benefit from this classification to automate routing of those messages. Here are a few scenario examples.

## First scenario: Contact us processing

A bicycle retailer has deployed an online store that generates visits and sales nationwide. Recently the retailer had to manage a peak in the management of the Contact Us form that the visitors on the website complete and then are sent to the general customer service group.

The service group is segmented by region, to provide localized responses to the customers. Most contact us form messages contain information that could help route them to the local segment.

With the help of entity extraction, information such as city, state, phone number, and street address can be identified, and rules can be set to forward the messages to the customer service queues for these areas.

## Second scenario: Financial questions or information

A law firm wants to monitor a central email address that the firm uses in most of its documents and presentations. If any question relates to invoicing, rates, or has any financial context, those email messages will be forwarded to the financial administrative group.

By processing the email messages with entity extraction and identifying those that contain monetary amounts, the targeted messages can be sent to the finance group.

## Third scenario: Organization names

A professional service group receives inquiries from customers and prospects in their sales dedicated email address. Those messages are routed as opportunities to review by the sales team.

One of the sales managers notices that in most email messages, the name of the organization is included. The manager wants the sales team to gain efficiency, so he forwards the messages to sales representatives dedicated to existing accounts when those messages relate to such accounts.

By processing the email messages with entity extraction and identifying if an organization is extracted from it, an automated process can then assign the messages to the sales representatives when that organization is under their management.

You now have learned how different scenarios can be resolved by using AI Builder entity extraction. Next, you'll learn how to use this model in Power Automate.
