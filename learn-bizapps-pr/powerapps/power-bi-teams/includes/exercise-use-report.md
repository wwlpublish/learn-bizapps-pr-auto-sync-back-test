The report is now ready to be used and embedded within Teams. In Teams, you can access Power BI reports and dashboards via the Power BI app, that is, the tool you've used to build the report. The Power BI app is a Teams-embedded version of Power BI Service. For easier access to the reports, you can embed the report in a channel for members to view and interact with.
