You'll see how to connect Power BI to Dataverse. You'll use Power BI Desktop to apply transformations to the data, and to optimize it for reporting. It can then be published to a workspace in Teams, where you'll build out and design your report to display data generated from the asset requests.

**Exercise 1: Connect to Dataverse and transform data**

You'll start by creating a Power BI workspace, where your report will be published. In these exercises, you'll connect to your Dataverse for Teams Swag Request tables and use Power Query in Power BI to apply transformations to the data. Transforming the data is required so that it is in a user-friendly format for the report.

**Exercise 2: Build your report in Teams**

In this exercise you'll, design your report and create visuals to display the data and insights.

**Exercise 3: Using the report**

Add the report to your Teams channel.

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download [Dataverse exercise file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/dataverse/dataverse-teams-exercise-files.zip) for use in this module. There are file folders in this download:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - package files to import the completed exercise steps. 
- **Student materials** - files used in the exercises.
