This module has four exercises. The flows created in the first two exercises of this lab aren't related to Swag Request solution you're building. They serve to help you learn the fundamentals of Power Automate and Teams.

**Exercise - Create a flow in Teams** In this exercise, you'll explore the Power Automate app for Teams and create a flow using a template. This flow allows you to follow up on a Teams message.

**Exercise - Collaboration** In this exercise you create a flow that will send a message to new team members requesting a bio, once submitted, welcome message together with their bio will post a message to a channel. In this flow, someone being added to your team is the trigger. You'll add other people from your lab group into your team during this exercise. You'll continue to collaborate in these teams throughout the later labs, to get the experience of using Teams for collaboration with colleagues.

**Exercise - Create an approval flow** Build a flow connecting to Dataverse for Teams that will trigger an approval process when a new request for swag is submitted via the app you built in the previous lab.

**Exercise - Create an approval notification** Extend the flow created in Exercise 3 to send a Teams message to the user to let them know whether their request has been approved or rejected.

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download [Dataverse exercise file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/dataverse/dataverse-teams-exercise-files.zip) for use in this module. There are file folders in this download:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - package files to import the completed exercise steps. 
- **Student materials** - files used in the exercises.
