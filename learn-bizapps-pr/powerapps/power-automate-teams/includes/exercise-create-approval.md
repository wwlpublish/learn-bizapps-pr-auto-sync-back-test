You can also create your own flows from blank and use them to connect with your Dataverse for Teams tables. To create flows, you'll need to work in the Power Apps application. In this exercise, you'll build a flow that will trigger an approval process when someone submits a new request for swag through the app that you built in the previous lab.

## Task - Create a flow from blank

To create a flow from blank, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Power Apps application by using the left navigation bar. Go to the **Build** tab. Select your team and then select **See all** at the bottom of the list of items created.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Build tab in Power Apps for Teams, highlighting the See all option.](../media/see-all.png)](../media/see-all.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Cloud flows** from the left menu and then select **New > Cloud flow > Automated**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of creating a new cloud flow with the Automated option highlighted.](../media/automated.png)

1. In the **Flow name** field, enter **Request approval**.

1. Search for the phrase **when a row is added** and then select **When a row is added, modified or deleted Microsoft Dataverse**. Select **Create**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of creating a flow with the flow name and the trigger set.](../media/request-approval.png)](../media/request-approval.png#lightbox)

1. You're now in the full Power Automate editor where you can build your own flow. The flow starts with a trigger which, in this case, is when a request is created in your Dataverse for Teams table. In the trigger action, select the following options:

   - **Change type** - Create

   - **Table name** - Requests

   - **Scope** - Organization

1. Select **+ New step**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the When a row is added action in the flow.](../media/new-step.png)

1. Add a step to get the name of the asset that the person requested. The asset is in a related table, so you'll need to use a **Get row by ID** action to retrieve all details of that asset. Search for the phrase **get a row by id** and then select the **Get a row by ID Microsoft Dataverse** action.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the Get a row by ID action being selected.](../media/get-row-id.png)

1. In the **Table name** dropdown menu, select **Assets**. In the **Row ID** section, select **Asset (Value)** from the **Dynamic content** pane.

1. A brief message will appear while the connection to the **Approvals** connector is being established. When the process is complete, select **Approve/Reject - First to respond** in the **Approval type** dropdown menu.

1. Fill in the rest of the **Start and wait for an approval** action as follows:

    - **Title** - Swag request
    - **Assigned to** - Enter the email address that you used to sign in for the lab and then select the name of the user when it appears

    > [!NOTE]
    > For training purposes, you'll approve or reject your own requests. In a real-world scenario, you would enter the name of the approving manager at this point, or you'd use the Office 365 connector to dynamically retrieve the name of the manager of the person who's making the request.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the Start and wait for an approval action, showing the Assigned to dropdown menu highlighted.](../media/assigned.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You might get the following warning message. This message is informing you that the functionality for approvals needs to be provisioned. The provisioning will happen automatically in the background and is a one-off process the first time you create an approval flow. You can ignore this message and move on to the next step.

1. Congratulations, you've finished building your first flow. Now, you can observe it in action. When your flow is saved, a confirmation message will display next to the name of the flow. After the flow has been saved, you can return to the team that you've been working on by selecting the main Teams icon in the left navigation bar.

1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to [Outlook](https://outlook.office365.com/?azure-portal=true) to open Outlook for your lab user account. An email with the approval request will display. You'll also receive a Teams notification with the same request.

1. Select **Approve**, provide a comment, and then select **Submit**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The approval connector can take up to 15 minutes to work the first time because it installs a solution behind the scenes. If the email doesn't appear immediately, take a break for 15 minutes and then return to it. After this first installation is complete, other approvals will come through almost instantly.
