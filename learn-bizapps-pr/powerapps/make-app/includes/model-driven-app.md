With the modern interface, makers can observe the effects of the changes that they make while they're designing, whereas with the classic interface, a level of abstraction exists between the final user experience and the design experience.

With both experiences, a [site map](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary?azure-portal=true#site-map) will be created that defines the navigation experience for users. With the modern approach, this experience is part of the app design process, whereas with the classic app designer, a separate site map designer is used.

We recommend that you create your model-driven app from a solution. A solution is a package that can contain Dataverse tables, forms, views, apps, flows, and other components. By building your model-driven app in a solution, you can move it to other environments or preserve a copy in your source control repository.

A well-designed model-driven app consists of several components that you select by using the designer to build the appearance and functionality of the finished app. The components and component properties that makers use to create an app become the metadata. These components are *data*, *UI*, *logic*, and *visualization* categories.

## Build a basic model-driven app

You can create a model-driven app by using standard tables that are available in Microsoft Dataverse plus custom tables that have been added through a solution. The model-driven app should allow salespeople to perform their sales duties in addition to checking in dive gear for service.

To create your app, you can follow the procedure that's detailed in [Build your first model-driven app](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app/?azure-portal=true).
