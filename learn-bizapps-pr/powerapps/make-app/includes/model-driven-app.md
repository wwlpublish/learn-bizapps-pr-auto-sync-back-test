With the modern interface makers can see the effects of the changes that they make whilst designing, whereas with the classic interface there's a level of abstraction between the final user experience and the design experience. More information:

With both experiences a [site map](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary?azure-portal=true#site-map) is created, defining the navigation experience for users. With the modern approach this is a part of the app design process, whereas with the classic app designer a separate site map designer is used.

We recommend creating your model-driven app from a solution. A solution is a package that can contain Dataverse tables, forms, views, apps, flows, and other components. By building your model- driven app in a solution, you can easily move it to other environments or preserve a copy in your source control repository.

A well-designed model-driven app consists of several components you select using the designer to build the appearance and functionality of the finished app. The components and component properties that makers use to create an app become the metadata. These components are d*ata*, *UI*, *logic*, and *visualization* categories.

## Build a basic Model Driven App

Create a model-driven app by using standard tables available in Microsoft Dataverse, plus custom tables added through a solution. The model-driven app should allow salespeople to perform their sales duties in addition to check dive gear in for service.

We'll be adding automated processes and logic in future exercises.

You can follow the procedure detailed in [this article](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app/?azure-portal=true) in order to create your app.
