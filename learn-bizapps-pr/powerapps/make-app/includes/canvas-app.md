To get started creating a canvas app, you can automatically generate an app from one of these sources, among others:

-   [A sample app](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/open-and-run-a-sample-app/?azure-portal=true)

-   [A template](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/get-started-test-drive/?azure-portal=true)

-   [Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/data-platform-create-app/?azure-portal=true)

-   [SharePoint](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/app-from-sharepoint/?azure-portal=true)

-   [Excel](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/get-started-create-from-data/?azure-portal=true)

Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true), select **Create** from the left pane, and under **Start from template**, choose a sample app from the list of sample apps, such as **Meeting Capture** or **Onboarding Tasks**.

After you generate an app automatically, you'll customize its default appearance and behavior based on your users' workflows. For example, you can change which types of data appear, how they're sorted, or whether users will specify a number by typing it or adjusting a slider. Additionally, you can add and customize [screens](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables/?azure-portal=true), [galleries](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/customize-layout-sharepoint/?azure-portal=true), [forms](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/customize-forms-sharepoint/?azure-portal=true), and other controls.

After you've gained some experience generating an app automatically and customizing it, you can create a new app based on [Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/data-platform-create-app-scratch/?azure-portal=true), [Excel](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/get-started-create-from-blank/?azure-portal=true), or another data source. By working from the ground up, you'll gain flexibility in app design, flow, and controls, and you can incorporate a larger variety of data sources.

## Build a basic canvas app

You can build a canvas app to manage data that's stored in Dataverse in relation to the service department by using standard tables (which are built-in, such as **Contact**) and custom tables (which your organization creates, such as **Dive Gear** and **Service Request**).

When you build an app from Dataverse, you don't need to create a connection from Power Apps as you do with data sources such as SharePoint, Dynamics 365, or Salesforce. You'll only need to specify the tables that you want to show or manage in the app.

The objective of this app will be for salespeople and technicians to check in gear for service or repair. To create your app, you can follow the procedure that's detailed in [Create a canvas app from scratch using Microsoft Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/data-platform-create-app-scratch/?azure-portal=true).
