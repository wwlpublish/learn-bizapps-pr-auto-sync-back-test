As you probably know by now, we can use Power Automate is used to ensure repetitive tasks are performed automatically by the solution instead of manually by a user.

During the Designing Phase of this implementation we identified multiple scenarios that can be automated within our app. For example, we'll automatically remind the customer in 12 months when it's time to book the next service for the gear they just picked up from the shop after being serviced. We'll build this flow on the next exercise.

There are multiple types of flows that you can create with Power Automate. You can create [cloud flows](/power-automate/flow-types?azure-portal=true#cloud-flows), [desktop flows](/power-automate/flow-types?azure-portal=true#desktop-flows), or [business process flows](/power-automate/flow-types?azure-portal=true#business-process-flows):
