Let's review the requirements for our three personas.

## The sales team

The sales team is responsible for selling dive gear. They connect gear to the customer and capture serial numbers. They identify cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and discuss new opportunities with the customer. Their main task is to complete a new sale and then identify other opportunities. They do this online, via their desktop or on their mobile device.

## The service team

The service team  fills in the service request form. They inspect New Dive Gear/Services Existing Gear and capture pictures of serviced gear and deliveries to customers. Their main task is to capture a new service request and complete service requests for new and existing dive gear. They do this online or on their mobile device.

## The general manager

The general manager performs weekly resource allocation based on new opportunities and reviews sales and service quotas based on work completed and closed sales. Their main task is resource allocation and sales and service performance reporting. They do this online or via their desktop.
