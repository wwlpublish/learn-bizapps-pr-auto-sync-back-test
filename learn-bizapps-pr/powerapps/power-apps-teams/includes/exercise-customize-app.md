Now that the data model has been created in Dataverse, you can customize the app that employees will use to submit their swag asset requests. Customizing the app in this exercise will involve editing the fields that are available on the asset request submission form and changing formatting, such as colors and font.

## Task: Edit the app form 

Your first task is to edit the app form by following these steps:

1.  Select the save icon to save your app.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the save button on the app canvas.](../media/save.png)](../media/save.png#lightbox)

1.  From your app canvas, select the **Tree view** icon on the left side of the screen. Within the **Tree view**, underneath **RightContainer1**, select **EditForm1** and then select **Edit fields**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Edit fields button in the app canvas.](../media/edit-fields.png)](../media/edit-fields.png#lightbox)

1.  Select **+ Add field** and then select to add the **Asset** and **Asset Category** fields.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Add field option, with Asset and Asset Category selected.](../media/add-field.png)](../media/add-field.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Edit fields** button located in the **Properties** pane.

	> [![Screenshot showing the Edit fields button in the Properties pane.](../media/properties-edit-fields.png)](../media/properties-edit-fields.png#lightbox)

1. Select and drag each field from the area to rearrange the order. The order should appear as shown in the following image. If you're missing any fields, you can add them.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the field order rearranged.](../media/field-order.png)](../media/field-order.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Approval status** field to expand it. Set the **Control type** to **View option set single-select**. Then, you can close the **Fields** menu.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Control type set as View option set single select.](../media/control-type.png)](../media/control-type.png#lightbox)

1. With **EditForm1** selected, change the **Columns** value to **1**, as shown in the following image.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Columns value being set to one.](../media/column-value.png)](../media/column-value.png#lightbox)

1. **Save** your app.

## Task: Import data

To import data, follow these steps:

1.  With your app saved, select the **Build** tab.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Build tab.](../media/build.png)](../media/build.png#lightbox)

1.  Select the Asset table.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Asset table selected.](../media/asset.png)](../media/asset.png#lightbox)

1.  Select **Import > Import Data**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Import data option selected.](../media/import-data.png)](../media/import-data.png#lightbox)

1.  Select the **Excel workbook** option.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Excel workbook option selected.](../media/excel-workbook.png)](../media/excel-workbook.png#lightbox)

1.  Select the **Upload file** option. Select **Browse** and then go to the Microsoft Excel file named **Contoso Coffee Asset List.xlsx** from your lab documents. Check that **Authentication kind** is set to **Organizational account** and then select **Sign in**.

    *If you get an error when trying to upload the file, refresh the page and try again*.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Excel file, the Authentication kind option set to Organizational account, and the Sign in button.](../media/sign-in.png)](../media/sign-in.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Next**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Next button in Power Query.](../media/next-button.png)](../media/next-button.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Load settings** section, select **Load to existing table**. You'll need to select the Asset table as the destination table. Your table will appear similar to **crf7d_Asset**. However, it likely won't be exactly the same as the example shown in this lab; your prefix might be different.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of Load to existing table selected and the table name highlighted.](../media/load-existing-table.png)](../media/load-existing-table.png#lightbox)

1. Map the **Source column** to the **Destination column**, as shown in the following image, and then select **Publish**.

	|     Source column    |     Destination column    |
	|----------------------|---------------------------|
	|     Image            |     Image                 |
	|     Asset Name       |     Name                  |
	|     Price            |     Price                 |

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Publish button in Power Query.](../media/publish.png)](../media/publish.png#lightbox)

1. Wait approximately two minutes and then refresh your browser. Return to the Asset table in the **Build** tab. Your list of assets should be populated.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Asset table on the Build tab.](../media/build-asset-table.png)](../media/build-asset-table.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Edit**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Edit button.](../media/edit.png)](../media/edit.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **+more** button to show the other columns. In the **Show existing column** section, select **Category**, **Image**, and **Price**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Show existing column section, showing Category, Image, and Price selected.](../media/existing-columns.png)](../media/existing-columns.png#lightbox)

1. Populate the **Category** column. Select the correct category for each asset.

	|     Asset Name                             |     Category     |
	|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
	|     Cappuccino Cup w/ Saucer               |     Accessory    |

	> [![Screenshot of Swag Request App being selected on the Build tab.](../media/swag-request-app-build.png)](../media/swag-request-app-build.png#lightbox)

## Task: Set up the app form

Your next task will be to set up the app form. In your form, you'll want the **Asset** field to be filtered based on the selected Asset category.

1.   On your canvas, select the **Asset** field, and then select under the label again to select the **DataCardValue**.
    
    You'll know if you've selected correctly when the panel on the right displays a COMBO BOX for DataCardValueX. (You might have a different number if you added the columns to the form in a different order, which is acceptable.)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the Properties panel, showing the Combo Box with the Data Card Value.](../media/data-card-value.png)](../media/data-card-value.png#lightbox)

1.  Select the **Advanced** tab and then select **Unlock to change properties**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Unlock to change properties button on the Advanced tab.](../media/unlock.png)](../media/unlock.png#lightbox)

1.  Select the **Properties** tab and then select **Depends on**. This selection will allow you to set a formula that will apply a filter to the Asset choices based on the Asset category that you've chosen.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Depends on button on the Properties tab.](../media/properties-dependency.png)](../media/properties-dependency.png#lightbox)

1.  Select the following options:
    
    Make your selections in the bottom half of the form first:

    **Matching field** - **Assets** and **Category**

    Then, select values in the top half of the form for **Parent control**:

    **Parent control** - **DataCardValue6** (see the following note) and **Name**

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure that you make the selections in this order. If you select the **Parent control** first, when you select the Asset table in the **Matching field** section, it will reset your selections in the top half of the form. If you've completed these actions in the wrong order, change the **Parent control** section back to what it should be so that it matches the following screenshot.
    >
    > You might have a different number for **DataCardValue6** if you added your columns in a different order. Only two options are available for you to choose from in the **Parent control** section: the first dropdown menu, which only has an option of **Value**, and the second dropdown menu, which allows you to select **Name**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the modified properties on the Data Card Value.](../media/modify-properties.png)](../media/modify-properties.png#lightbox)

1.  Select **Apply**.

    A formula will appear in the formula bar, and you'll get a warning icon on your canvas and an error flag on your app checker. You'll need to manually add one more component to the formula to correct this issue. This component isn't something that you can choose from the **Depends on** selections.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the formula in the formula bar and the warning icon.](../media/warning.png)](../media/warning.png#lightbox)

1.  Edit the formula. Select at the end of the word **Category**, type a dot (period/full stop) and then type the letter **N**. Select **Name** from the list of options that appears.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of Name selected from a list of options.](../media/name.png)](../media/name.png#lightbox)

Your final formula will resemble the following example, and the error and warning messages will be cleared.

	`Filter(Assets, Category.Name = DataCardValue6.Selected.Name)`

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the final formula without the error and warning messages.](../media/final-formula.png)](../media/final-formula.png#lightbox)

### Locale differences

If your computer has its regional settings set to use the comma ',' for its decimal separator (as is done in much of Europe), your formulas will use a semicolon ';' instead of a comma. Instead, your formula will appear as shown in the following example. If you're in the en-us locale, you can ignore this example.

`Filter(Assets; Category.Name = DataCardValue6.Selected.Name)`

1.  **Save** and then select to **preview** the app.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Save and Preview buttons.](../media/save-preview.png)](../media/save-preview.png#lightbox)

1.  When you preview the app for the first time, no data will show in the requests table, so you'll get a blank, "No item to display" message.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the preview app showing the No item to display message.](../media/preview.png)](../media/preview.png#lightbox)

1.  While in preview mode, select the **+ New record** button, enter request details, and then select the checkmark to submit your request. Repeat this process so that you have three requests in your app. Your dependent dropdown menus are working (you'll get different Asset choices based on the Asset category that you've chosen), and the **Approval Status** and **Request Number** fields are read only.

	When submitting requests, try to use a variation of options because this data will be used to build a Microsoft Power BI report later in another lab in this learning path.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the preview app in Power Apps, showing requests being submitted.](../media/submit-request.png)](../media/submit-request.png#lightbox)

1.  After you've submitted at least three requests, close the preview.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of close preview button.](../media/close-preview.png)](../media/close-preview.png#lightbox)

## Task: Add an image to the form

You can add an image to the form by following these steps:

1.  On the **Screens** tab, from the **EditForm1** dropdown menu, select **Asset_DataCard1**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screeshot of the Asset Data Card selected.](../media/asset-data-card.png)](../media/asset-data-card.png#lightbox)

1. From the ribbon, select **Insert > Media > Image**, which will add a blank image inside **Asset_DataCard1**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Insert, Media, Image path.](../media/insert-image.png)](../media/insert-image.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Asset_DataCard1** and then drag the bottom border from the canvas to increase the size of the cell until it appears as shown in the following screenshot.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the resized border.](../media/border-size.png)](../media/border-size.png#lightbox)

1. Select the image that you previously added (**Image2**). Reposition and resize it so that it appears on your screen, as shown in the following image.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of positioning and sizing the image.](../media/position-size.png)](../media/position-size.png#lightbox)

1. With **Image2** selected, type the following formula into the formula bar. Ensure that the dropdown/property next to the formula bar is set to **Image**.

	`DataCardValue5.Selected.Image`

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of entering the formula in the formula bar, showing the property set as Image.](../media/enter-formula.png)](../media/enter-formula.png#lightbox)

	*In the formula, **DataCardValue5** refers to the **DataCardValue** for the **Asset** field. If your form is in a different order, your number might not be 5.*

1. Select **BrowseGallery1** from under **LeftContainer1**. When you select the gallery, a pen icon will appear. Select the pen icon.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the pen icon.](../media/pen.png)](../media/pen.png#lightbox)

1. Selecting the pen icon will select the first cell of the gallery. Select the image (**Image1**) within the cell.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the gallery image.](../media/gallery-image.png)](../media/gallery-image.png#lightbox)

1. With **Image1** selected, type the following formula into the formula bar. Ensure that the dropdown/property next to the formula bar is set to **Image**.

	`ThisItem.Asset.Image`

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of modifications to Browse Gallery 1, showing the property set to Image.](../media/modify-image.png)](../media/modify-image.png#lightbox)

1. **Save** and **preview** the app. Test it out by creating a new request. As you select an asset in the form, the image will update. Close the preview when you're done.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of Power Apps in preview mode.](../media/preview-mode.png)](../media/preview-mode.png#lightbox)

## Task: Set up the app design 

When creating an app, you'll have full control of designing the screens. In this case, you'll be using colors to match with the overall theme of Microsoft Teams.

1.  From the **Tree view** (menu on the left of the app canvas), select **Screen1**. On the **Properties** pane for **Screen1**, change the **Fill** property to the custom value of **E1DFDD**, as shown in the following images.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the change color fill icon.](../media/change-color.png)](../media/change-color.png#lightbox)

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the color selection screen.](../media/color-selection.png)](../media/color-selection.png#lightbox)

1.  From the **Tree view**, select **TopBar_RightContainer1** and then select its color property from the **Properties** pane.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the color property.](../media/color-property.png)](../media/color-property.png#lightbox)

1.  Change the color of **TopBar_RightContainer1** to the light purple color, as shown in the following image.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the color changed to light purple.](../media/purple.png)](../media/purple.png#lightbox)

1.  From the **Tree view**, expand **LeftContainer1** and select **TopBar_LeftContainer1**. Change the color property to match the light purple color that you chose in the previous step. Your app should now appear as shown in the following screenshot.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of modifying to the light purple color to match.](../media/match-color.png)](../media/match-color.png#lightbox)

1.  Expand **TopBar_LeftContainer1** and select **AppNameLabel1**. In the **Properties** pane, set the **Text** value to **Swag Requests** and then change the **Font size** value to **20**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Text value set as Swag Requests and the Font size value changed to 20.](../media/swag-requests.png)](../media/swag-requests.png#lightbox)

1.  Select **LeftControlContainer1**. Change the color property to purple, as shown in the following screenshot.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of Left Control Container 1 with its color changed to purple.](../media/purple-color-property.png)](../media/purple-color-property.png#lightbox)

1.  Expand **LeftControlContainer1** and then expand **IconButton_Add1**. Select **IconButton_Add_Label1** and change its **Text** property to **New request** and the **Font size** to **14**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of modifying the Icon Button Add Label 1 properties.](../media/icon-button-modify-properties.png)](../media/icon-button-modify-properties.png#lightbox)

1.  Change the text color of **IconButton_Add_Label1** to white.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the text color changed to white.](../media/white-text.png)](../media/white-text.png#lightbox)

1.  Select **BrowseGallery1**. Within the gallery, select the first text box that appears with the title. Go to the formula bar and change the **FontSize** property to **12**. You can drag the text box to readjust the size so that the text is displayed in full.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the font size adjusted for the text box.](../media/text-font-size.png)](../media/text-font-size.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Subtitle1** field, that is, the other text label, within the gallery. Change the **FontSize** property to **10**.

1. In the formula bar at the top of the screen, change the property dropdown menu to **Text**, and then enter the following formula.

	`ThisItem.'Created By'.'Full Name'& " - "& ThisItem.'Created On'`

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the property changed to Text and the formula added.](../media/formula-added.png)](../media/formula-added.png#lightbox)

1.  From the **Tree view**, select **BrowseGallery1**, and then select the pen icon that appears in the upper-left corner of the gallery.

1.  Selecting the pen icon will allow you to readjust the cell of the gallery. Resize it to provide increased space between the cells.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the cell resized to increase space.](../media/increase-space.png)](../media/increase-space.png#lightbox)

1. Increase the size of **Image1** and then move it slightly to the right, as shown in the following screenshot.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the image moved slightly.](../media/move-image.png)](../media/move-image.png#lightbox)

1. Resize and reposition **Title1** and **Subtitle1** so that they appear as shown in the following image. Increase the space of both so that each takes up two line spaces. This approach is used so that text can overflow into the next line if necessary. You might need to reposition the image and increase the size of the cell so that it sits accurately.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the title and subtitle size and position changed.](../media/size-position.png)](../media/size-position.png#lightbox)

1. **Save** your app.

1. Add a colored bar to each item to show the approval status. Select **BrowseGallery1** and then select the pen icon, as you did previously, so that the first cell of the gallery is selected. Select **Insert** from the ribbon and then select **rectangle**. A rectangle should now appear in each cell of the gallery.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Insert dropdown menu and the Rectangle option.](../media/rectangle.png)](../media/rectangle.png#lightbox)

1. Resize and move the rectangle so that it appears as shown in the following image.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the rectangle resized and moved.](../media/move-rectangle.png)](../media/move-rectangle.png#lightbox)

1. With the rectangle selected, change the property dropdown menu to **Fill**, and then enter the following formula into the formula bar. All rectangles will change to a gold color.

	`Switch(Text(ThisItem.'Approval Status'),"Approved", Green,"Rejected",OrangeRed,Gold)`

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the formula for the rectangle and the retangles changed to a gold color.](../media/rectangle-formula.png)](../media/rectangle-formula.png#lightbox)

### Locale differences

If your computer has its regional settings set to use the comma ',' for its decimal separator (as is done in much of Europe), your formulas will need to use a semicolon ';' instead of a comma. Instead, use the following formula. If you're in the en-us locale, you can ignore this directive.

`Switch(Text(ThisItem.'Approval Status');"Approved"; Green;"Rejected";OrangeRed;Gold)`

1. Go to view your data sources and then select **Edit data** on the Requests table.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Edit data button on the Requests table.](../media/edit-table-data.png)](../media/edit-table-data.png#lightbox)

1.  In the Requests table, set the value of the **Approval Status** column for one row to **Approved**. For the next row, set it to **Rejected**. Leave the third row (and extra rows that you might have) blank. Close the table.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Approval Status column, showing one row set to Approved and the next row set to Rejected.](../media/approval-status.png)](../media/approval-status.png#lightbox)

    The conditional formatting of the rectangle will appear based on the **Approval Status** field for each row.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the conditional formatting of the rectangle.](../media/conditional-formatting.png)](../media/conditional-formatting.png#lightbox)

1.  On the form, select the Data Card Key for the Name card (that is, **DataCardKeyX**). From the **Properties** pane, change the **FontSize** property to **12**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the font size changed to 12 and the Data Card Key selected.](../media/font-size.png)](../media/font-size.png#lightbox)

1.  Set the color to **Purple**, as shown in the following screenshot. Set the **Font weight** property to **Bold**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the color set to purple and the Font weight property set to Bold.](../media/purple-bold.png)](../media/purple-bold.png#lightbox)

1.  Repeat the formatting changes from the previous the step to the **DataCardKey** for the **Asset Category**, **Asset**, and **Comment** cards of the form.

1.  On the Data Card Key of the **Approval Status** and **Request Number** cards, set the **Font size** to **12** and the font **Color** to **dark gray**. Resize the cards to ensure that the text is fully visible.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the font size set to 12 and the color set to dark gray.](../media/font-size-color.png)](../media/font-size-color.png#lightbox)

1.  Select **Image2** from **Asset_DataCard1** (that is, the image of the asset within the form). Move it to the left, as shown in the following image.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the image moved to the left.](../media/image-moved.png)](../media/image-moved.png#lightbox)

1.  **Save** and **preview** the app. From the app, you can also select a past request to view or edit it from the form.

 Your app should now resemble the following image.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the finished app.](../media/finished-app.png)](../media/finished-app.png#lightbox)
