In this lab, you created a data model for storing asset information and requests for swag orders using Microsoft Dataverse for Teams. You then saw how you can build an app to connect to your data model for employees to interact with. The app was configured and designed using different styling and formulas for customization. The app was then published to a Microsoft Teams channel so that it can be used by members of the team.
