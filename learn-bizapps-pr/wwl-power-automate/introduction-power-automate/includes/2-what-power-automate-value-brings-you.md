Do you find yourself regularly downloading email attachments and then uploading
the file to the database? Power Automate can help. Does the process of getting a
new purchase order approved involve you taking a form from desk to get
sign off? Power Automate can help. Do you have to log into a website every
morning, find the daily numbers, and then save those into another system? Power
Automate can help.

Power Automate is all about having computers manage repetitive tasks. Power
Automate allows anyone with knowledge of the business process to create a
repeatable flow that when triggered, leaps into action and performs the process.

Common scenarios and capabilities of Power Automate:

-   Automating of repetitive tasks like moving data from one system to another

-   Guiding a user through a process so they can complete the different stages

-   Connecting to external data sources via one of the hundreds of connectors or
    directly via an API

-   Automating desktop based and website processes with robotic process
    automation (RPA) capabilities

### Example: a purchase order approval

Approvals are a great process to build in Power Automate. They are often defined
yet manual. Check out the following scenario for an example:

A user starts the process by going into a Power Apps app and creating a purchase
order request. Once they submit the request, the information is sent to a Power
Automate flow.

The flow can be built to evaluate the request and then route the request based
on criteria such as submitting user and request amount. The first action could
be to send the request to the user's manager. The manager could be automatically
retrieved from Azure AD, avoiding prompting for duplicate information.

Here is the starting point of the flow:

After the manager receives the approval and approves, the flow can then provide conditional logic. Typically, this might be something like: if the purchase order request is greater than $10,000, send it to VP; if not, then automatically approve the purchase order.

Here is an example of what this flow may look like.

As you can see, even the business process has many decision points. Your flow easily handles the decisions without you writing any code.

## Work with your data where it lives

When building an app, access to your data is very important. Power Automate
offers you choices; through over 600 connectors you can easily connect to data
and services across the web and even on-premises. Some common data sources
include:

-  Microsoft Dataverse

-  Salesforce

-  Dynamics 365

-  Google Drive

-  Office 365

You don't have to choose just one data source either. Microsoft Power Platform
easily supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together
from many platforms into a single automation.

Finally, if your data isn't retrievable by one of the 600 plus connectors, then
Power Automate also allows you to create custom connectors, letting you talk to
any data source via a swagger file.

## The three types of flows you can create with Power Automate

Power Automate works by creating flows, of which there are three types:

-   Cloud flows - These are flows that you build with a trigger and then one or
    more actions. There are a multitude of triggers and actions available such
    as the arrival of an email from a specific person, or a mention of your
    company in social media, thanks to the existing connectors. You'll see
    these as My flows and Team flows in Power Automate. The only difference
    between a My flow and a Team flow is ownership. With a My flow you're the
    sole owner, while a Team flow has more than one owner.

-   Business process flows - These flows are built to augment the experience
    when using Model-driven apps and Microsoft Dataverse. Use these to create a
    guided experience in your Model-driven apps.

-   Desktop flows - These robotic process automation (RPA) flows allow you to
    record yourself performing actions on your desktop or within a web browser.
    You can then trigger a flow to perform that process for you. You can also
    pass data in or get data out of the process, letting you automate even
    "manual" business processes.

## Add artificial intelligence to your flow without writing code

Before Microsoft Power Platform, adding functionality such as image or text
processing required an advanced computer or coding knowledge. There was code to
write, data models to design and train, and a lot of complicated logic.
Microsoft Power Platform, however, has "democratized" artificial intelligence by
providing a wizard-based interface for building and training your model. This
unlocks the power of Azure Machine Learning and Cognitive services without
writing a single line of code.

To take advantage of these AI capabilities you must first build a model. From
<https://make.PowerApps.com> a wizard guides you through building and training
the model.

## Security and Administration

To manage security for Power Automate, log into
[https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
From the Microsoft Power Platform admin center you have full access to Power
Automate tenant wide. You have the ability to create and manage environments,
implement Data Loss Prevention policies, work with Data integrations, manage
user licenses, and quotas. The admin center gives you management capabilities
across Power Automate.

Power Automate also offers a full set of PowerShell cmdlets. These cmdlets allow
you deeper controls and to work better in large-scale scenarios. Using the
cmdlets for auditing gives you more control and insight on Power Automate's
usage throughout your tenant.

In addition, because Power Automate is all about automation, there are built in
flow actions for managing both Power Automate and Power Apps. An example of a
helpful flow is you could create one that runs everyday at 8 AM to discover all
of the flows and Power Apps that have been created and then add someone from IT
as a co-owner of each. That way IT has access and awareness of the solutions
within the organization. Just another way that Power Automate is helping to
automate common business processes.

## Driving business value

Power Automate flows are built with triggers and actions. Triggers determine
what starts the flows, while actions determine what happens. With Power Automate
you even have the ability to specify the business logic to determine the
necessary conditions. For many businesses that means these automations do not
have to be driven from IT but instead directly from the business. The same way
that the Sales department builds its manual processes today by emailing
spreadsheets between people, they can build their flow to automate the process
going forward.

If you are in IT or otherwise responsible for governance, Power Automate has
plenty to offer for you. With Power Automate there are many security,
governance, and reporting capabilities to provide the necessary oversight. You
can even write a flow to manage all of the other flows. Also, Power Automate
doesn't circumvent security in any way. Users cannot build flows to do things
they don't already have permission to do today.

better run their business.
