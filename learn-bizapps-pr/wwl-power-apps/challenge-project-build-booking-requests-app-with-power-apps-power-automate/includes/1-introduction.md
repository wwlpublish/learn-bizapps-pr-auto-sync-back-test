<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: orient the learner to the area covered in this module

    Heading: none

    Example: "Azure Logic Apps let you automate your business processes and run them in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence(s)

    [Introduction unit guidance](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-introductions?branch=main#rule-use-the-standard-module-introduction-format)
-->
Create your own data model, app, and flow to support a scenario for a fictional company. You'll be provided with high-level specifications on the custom tables, columns, canvas app, and flows needed to complete this project.

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario, use the image markdown extension (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=main#images)

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

## Example scenario
Contoso Pet Boarding is a local pet boarding facility and veterinary care practice. Lately, customers have requested a way to submit booking requests for pet boarding without having to call the office. You would like to create an app that allows customers to submit the information for their booking request for the office to review. You would like customers to be alerted when their booking request has been reviewed and approved or rejected. You want to build an app that allows you to capture these booking requests and decide to accept or decline the booking. 

Bookings previously could only be requested over the phone, causing the Contoso phone line to always be busy. Despite their importance, many customers couldn't get through to the office to request their services. Long wait times could mean customers get frustrated and hang up. This can result in loss of business for Contoso.

A well-built app with some simple automation provides customers with the ability to submit their booking request information on their own time, reducing the time waiting on the phone. Happy customers are likely to share their experience with others and increase business for Contoso Pet Boarding.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->
## What will we be doing?
- Create custom tables and columns in Dataverse
- Build a Power Apps canvas app that takes user input and creates rows in your custom table
- Build Power Automate cloud flows to send notifications when new rows are created in your table

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

 -->
## What is the main goal?
By the end of this session, you'll have a working solution that validates your knowledge of concepts covered in PL-100: Microsoft Power Platform App Maker. If you haven't taken the exam already, you may be ready!
